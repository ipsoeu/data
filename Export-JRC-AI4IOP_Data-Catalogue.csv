347,AIWT6-347,Support system for classification of citizen inquiries or complaints,https://atencioenlinia.ajuntament.barcelona.cat,"Support system for the classification of incidences/complains from citizens in Barcelona. 
IRIS is the service that allows citizens to report incidents or send complaints to the Barcelona City Council for resolution. Through IRIS, citizens can send information and queries, as well as complaints and suggestions for improvement. In this process, the citizen who reports the incident has to classify it using a tree of topics offered through the computer application. This classification is important because it is used to direct the incident directly to the responsible department, thus speeding up the response process. Errors in the thematic classification cause inadequate responses and delays in the resolution of incidents, thus affecting the quality of the service offered.
As part of the IRIS service update project, a module called MARIO has been developed, based on machine learning algorithms -Machine Learning- and natural language processing (one of the technologies included in the IA) to simplify the incident classification process for citizens. From the analysis of the free text describing the incident, MARIO suggests to the citizen the most likely categories where the incident fits because he/she chooses the most appropriate category.
MARIO, which is currently being tested, minimizes the error rate in the initial classification of incidents by greatly reducing manual reclassification processes. Previously, 50% of the communications made needed to be reassigned; now, with MARIO, a hit rate of over 85% is being achieved.
MARIO has been developed using open source tools -Open Source- such as Python, Scikit-*learn and *Pandas, among others. The algorithm has required a training that has been carried out using a dataset with the topics and questions asked by the citizen previously validated to ensure that they have been correctly classified.
This pilot has been used by the Municipal Institute of Informatics to evaluate the techniques and processes of text classification with the following conclusions:
Often the integration of AI techniques into existing processes has to be accompanied by a restructuring of the data. In the case of IRIS, the wide range of classification options makes the task difficult for a human but makes *IA inefficient. Clustering of categories is recommended
- It is important to have a quality dataset.
- In order to ensure good system efficiency, good data preprocessing including cleaning and standardization of this data is necessary.
- Data anonymization must be taken into account.

The new machine translation solution simplifies the understanding of registry data for non-Estonian speaking citizens. The tool helps the user of the e-Land Register to understand detailed data, such as easements and mortgages. It is a tool based on neural networks. Machine translation creates links from a large database, which improves itself over time, refining vocabulary and thus improving translation quality. However, the official language of the register is Estonian, which is why the translated text is informative and has no legal significance. The machine translation tool was developed in cooperation between Estonia, Latvia and Belgium within the framework of the project for the creation of middleware adapting European machine translation, which was developed by the Latvian cooperation partner TILDE SIA.",National,Estonia,EE,"Center of Registers and Information Systems

The solution has brought significant improvements to the efficiency and speed of producing court session recordings and protocolling. Speech recognition models have been adapted for the rather rich domain content – more than 800 hours of transcribed audio files have been used for the development of the acoustic models and over 800 million words worth of textual data have been used for the custom language model development. As a result, the solution which provides for real-time, as well as offline speech recognition has high quality of speech recognition, where word error rates (WER) vary between 8 and 15%, and this is a very good result given the actual conditions at court hearings.

708,AIWT6-708,Taxation and the automatization of property evaluation, ,"For years, and with varying degrees of success, the Danish government has tried to centralize and automate tax administration. Attempts to centralize and automate tax collection in 2005 with EFI (Et Fælles Inddrivelsessystem or One Shared Tax collection system) failed, and EFI was shelved in 2015 (Alfter, 2019, 51). A new system, to collect billions of Danish crowns owed by taxpayers, was expected to be finalized by mid-2019, however, in September 2019, the Auditors of the Danish Parliament, Rigsrevision, published a critical report indicating that tax collection would only be fully up and running by the end of 2020, or later (Rigsrevisionen, 2019).

Missing out on collecting billions of Danish crowns in tax revenue, however, is just one of several automatization concerns on the table of every new minister of finance. One heated discussion is about automatizing the estimation of property values – particularly in a context where housing costs are growing significantly in the capital and near larger cities while they are dropping elsewhere, thus affecting property owners in a country where large parts of the population own their own home. Passed in 2017, the Ejendomsvurderingslov (law on property assessment, 2017) states that automatic real estate valuation assessment will become standard practice. In preparation for the law, this fully automated system was described as “machine assessments” (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 36-37). The system is set to include “sales prices related to the neighborhood, location and size. Sales price levels are adjusted to take into account the distance to forests and recreation areas, schools, streets, railways”. The system will also take into account whether or not there is the possibility to build on the surrounding terrain and whether or not ground pollution is an issue (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). A total of 19 parameters will be used to automatically calculate property value (Version2 Editorial, 2019). A preparatory committee prepared an analysis to guide the government ahead of the legislation. The committee followed the overall line to move from “subjective to objective” assessments, from human to digital assessments, and from manual to automatic administration, to improve assessments and lower administration costs (Engbergudvalget, 2014, p. 68-69). While it does not explicitly mention it, this model uses a level of machine learning to develop a “statistical predictive model” (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). Furthermore, the overall assumption of the preparatory committee was that machine assessments were more objective than human assessments, where human assessments are considered subjective. As with many other systems, the automated property assessment system has been significantly delayed. Along the way, fears surfaced that it did not comply with Danish administrative law (Mølsted, 2018). It also proved to be more expensive than the estimate in the initial report regarding the cost of a property valuation calculated by a human (Motzfeldt, 2019-2). This project, and other problematic attempts by the Danish tax authorities to incorporate IT projects, have been described as “the ministers’ (…) IT-phantoms” (Version2 Editorial, 2019). The law to assess property values allows a variation of 40% in the value of a given property – 20% either side of the price calculated by the system – “and one does not need to hold a PhD in human behavior to predict that this will lead to protests if or when the system comes into use. Worst case we will see headlines that two newly built and identical houses will be taxed very differently. Could we blame citizens if they ask critical questions why they had to spend billions for a system with such a low level of precision” (Motzfeldt, 2019-2).",National,Denmark,DK,Danish Tax Authority,Central-Government,General public services,"Executive and legislative organs, financial and fiscal affairs, external affairs.",Implemented,2021,,Reasoning,Automated reasoning,Planning and Scheduling,,,,,Enforcement,Predictive enforcement processes,Artificial Intelligence,,,,G2G,Dynamic Data,Streaming Data,,AI4IOP,No,Yes,Yes,No,Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency,Administrative simplification,Calculation?,,FALSE,,,,,,Improved Administration Efficency,Improved Administrative Efficiency,,,x,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/denmark/,25/05/2021,

The agency has the ability to obtain all the data contained on the devices and run software on it. The software presents the employee with a limited overview of the content, which also includes language analysis of the text retrieved. According to the BAMF, both the software and the hardware was provided by the firm Atos SE, however, VICE Magazine found evidence,   that the mobile forensic technology firm MSAB was also involved. Another tool deployed by the BAMF aims to identify disguised dialects in speech. When an asylum seeker does not have a valid proof of ID, a two-minute voice recording of the person describing a picture in their mother tongue is analyzed by software, which then calculates a percentage of how close the speech comes to a certain dialect.

Precisely the idea that the advancement of knowledge with its applicative implications offers pieces to be organized modularly in multiple ways has convinced us to organize the work in building-blocks projects. The ambitions are multiple and transversal: from the attempt to ""export"" knowledge, techniques, and solutions across disciplines (for example from omics to legal data mining) to the combination of protocols and software to automate the pseudonymization of texts or to the creation of innovative tools for querying legal materials through their automatic annotation to the construction of prediction tools based on data science and Intelligence Artificial, to the attempt to offer understandable explanations on the functioning of the tools produced / used adapting them to the needs / capabilities of the different end users. ? ?All these steps are obviously articulated in full coherence with the corresponding regulatory and ethical framework, convinced that the regulatory and ethical profiles in research are central and go beyond mere adherence to the rules. ?",Regional,Italy,IT,"Tribunal of Pisa (and EMbeDS, KDD Lab)",Local Government,Public order and safety,Law courts,In development,2021,,Learning,Machine learning,Searching,,,,,Internal management,Internal primary processes,Artificial Intelligence,No,No,,G2G,Dynamic Data,Streaming Data,,AI4IOP,No,Yes,Yes,No,Reusability,Administrative simplification,Decision Support,,FALSE,,,,,,Improved Administration Efficency,Improved Administrative Efficiency,,,x,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://www.lanazione.it/pisa/cronaca/la-giustizia-diventa-predittiva-con-l-intelligenza-artificiale-della-scuola-sant-anna-1.6390186,25/05/2021,

Converting voice data into searchable text using automated transcription services may save significant time and create actionable value. With this solution, 100% manual transcription is no longer necessary, and efforts can be focused on correction and completion.
