The data includes statistics from different government agencies, such as school attendance, housing information, economic indicators, and others. This allows early intervention to these families, avoiding the occurrence of a crisis with more expensive follow-up actions.  Each month, the social workers team gets a list of 20 families who are of high risk and unknown to the social workers at that time. Social workers then decide based on the information to conduct an early intervention, such as support from a child centre or a health assessment. It has been reported that the model had a high accuracy, with more than 80% of the risk alerts deemed valid, despite challenges with continuous updating of some data sources. The system was expected to help councils save around one million euro per year by having early, targeted interventions. However, the system was heavily criticized. The nature of the data collection and the risk assessment was very opaque as data is processed by a private company, leading to concerns by citizens. Those whose data was used were not informed and it was kept a secret which indicators were to determine the risks, since a private company was responsible for the development and argued that the information was commercially sensitive. Others noticed that the system was only put in place to cope with the austerity measures put in place, as the system was advertised to maximize payments from the Troubled Families programme.

Triage is based on a specific clinical algorithm (out of a set of 59), and the choice of the most appropriate algorithm is extremely important and relevant. The selected clinical algorithm should ensure high safety (not failing to identify situations that require urgent medical contact) and should have high discriminatory capability. In this context, the SNS24 Scout.AI will apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, aiming the development of decision support tools with two main objectives: (1) Support the nurse in the selection of the most appropriate clinical algorithm and (2) Provide support to Directorate-General of Health (DGS) in the optimization process of the design of clinical algorithms and their referrals. The first objective will be achieved by identifying the most appropriate algorithms for a given set of symptoms, with adjustment for age and sex. The AI methodology to be applied will be based on a classifier built on automatic learning algorithms on an anonymised data set, obtained from contacts of the SNS 24 in 2017 and 2018. This data represents accumulated experience in around 2 million cases. After the creation of the prediction model, it will be implemented in the SNS 24 TAE Service as decision support, indicating in real time which algorithms are most likely to be used.",National,Portugal,PT,"SPMS - Shared Services of the Ministry of Health, EPE",Central-Government,Health,Health n.e.c.,In development,2021,,Enforcement,Supporting inspection processes,No,No,Artificial Intelligence,G2C,x,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Survey Use and impact of AI in the public sector. 2021 (https://ai-watch.ec.europa.eu/news/survey-artificial-intelligence-use-public-sector-2021-06-11_en),Reasoning,Knowledge representation,Optimisation,,,,10/11/2023

1. Named entity recognition (NER)
-Stanford NER software to recognize persons and place names from the Finnish historical newspapers. The first training and evaluation data set was created that consists of pages of both journals and newspapers from the time period 1836–1918. The Stanford NER system was trained using 220 annotated pages and evaluated using 34 pages. The results that were achieved were mostly good: 71 % of person names and 79 % of place names were recognized from the evaluation data.
2. Image classification
-Google TensorFlow was used to classify images.
A training dataset was created that was used to train the classifier model with TensorFlow. Using the trained model, it was possible to classify images into the following groups: advertisements, drawings, notes, pictures, paintings, maps or garbage.
-The trained model was used to classify 50 000 images and its accuracy was about 70-75% when about 10 000 classified images were manually observed.

The solution has brought significant improvements to the efficiency and speed of producing court session recordings and protocolling. Speech recognition models have been adapted for the rather rich domain content – more than 800 hours of transcribed audio files have been used for the development of the acoustic models and over 800 million words worth of textual data have been used for the custom language model development. As a result, the solution which provides for real-time, as well as offline speech recognition has high quality of speech recognition, where word error rates (WER) vary between 8 and 15%, and this is a very good result given the actual conditions at court hearings.

The optical remote-sensing data with 250 m resolution acquired by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002–2011 were used for statistical characterization of sea ice. A method based on bimodal histogram analysis of remote-sensing reflectance data was developed to discriminate ice from water. In general, ice extent information obtained from MODIS data agrees with the official ice chart data (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and in situ measurements) and multi-sensor product containing data from microwave and infrared instruments (R² >0.83). However, in case of severe winters and extremely mild winters there are differences in the dates when maximum ice extent is registered. MODIS data can be used for detailed analysis of ice extent in specific basins of Baltic Sea. Depending on the year, the ice season length in the Gulf of Riga ranged from 68 to 146 days, and the maximum ice extent varied greatly from 329 to 15,350 km². SIOP and number of ice days increased significantly in areas where the depth is less than 15 m. Based on negative-degree days and ice cover characteristics (SIOP and ice season length), three winter scenarios were defined: severe (2003, 2006, 2010, and 2011), medium (2004 and 2005), and mild (2007, 2008, and 2009).",National,Estonia,EE,Tallinn University of Technology,Academic-Research,Environmental protection,R&D environmental protection.,Pilot,2017,,"Analysis, monitoring and regulatory research",Information analysis processes,No,No,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,,,,,,,x,,x,x,,,,,,,,,https://www.kratid.ee/kasutuslood-kratid,Perception,Computer vision,Automated reasoning,,,,15/11/2023

The men and women in white suits. “But our field of work goes much further than that,” says Lisanne van Dijk. In principle, we have three core tasks. Firstly, investigating cases for the police and the prosecution, we also do the research and development to support case investigation. Finally, we are responsible for knowledge exchange and education on these topics.’
The NFI also provides data support to other parts of the government. ‘The classical statistics that belong to our field are well suited to that. Also in combination with AI. “Explainable AI” is especially important, so AI explaining exactly which data is used and how, for example, it is weighed in an algorithm.
One of the AI projects at NFI is the automatic recognition of images. The FIRE (Forensic Image Recognition) system is designed to relieve detection staff. ‘You can of course imagine everything in image recognition, but before we can use this everywhere we start with a few framed fields. For example, the recognition of sea containers: can we learn AI to recognise containers that have potentially illegal cargo? For the recognition of this image, huge amounts of data carriers and data are analysed. “If this succeeds, we might be able to bring people’s work back to a few hours with the help of AI,” says Van Dijk enthusiastically. But it’s not that far. ‘We need to first look at how we can compile, store and use datasets. There is, of course, a legal challenge. It is very good that we are bound by rules, but it would be interesting if we could find a solution that all security services can use together.",National,Netherlands,NL,Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI),Central-Government,Public order and safety,Police Services,Pilot,2020,,Enforcement,Smart Recognition processes,No,No,Artificial Intelligence,G2B,x,,,x,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hoekstra, M., Chideock, C., & Veenstra, A.F. van (2021).

PSTW-391,INZNAK Project - Intelligent road signs for adaptive vehicle traffic control, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8883382,"In response to the desire to improve road safety and vehicle traffic, the INZNAK project was proposed. This project aims to improve road traffic by developing and building a network of autonomous road signs. The use of intelligent road signs in road traffic will prevent the most common collisions on highways, resulting from speed not being adapted to weather conditions, the condition of the surface and damming? vehicles in the event of a need to brake suddenly. During the project, 3 types of signs will be developed: standing, hanging and mobile. Each sign will have a display that will present hints for drivers along with a suggested speed. Hints will be displayed in the form of text and image messages, which will warn or inform about current traffic disruptions. Thanks to the use of a string of signs placed along the road, drivers will be warned much faster about possible dangers on the road. This is due to the fact that each of the signs will communicate with the others, making it easier to manage traffic. The signs will communicate in LoraWan and LTE technology. LoraWan technology will enable the characters to communicate with each other. And LTE technology will be used to send and receive messages from the traffic control center. The use of two-level communication allows the solution to become independent from possible failures of the telecommunications infrastructure. To ensure the flow of up-to-date information to autonomous signs, it is necessary to equip them with a number of sensors, which will analyze the traffic in the vicinity of the sign on an ongoing basis. The experimental installations of intelligent signs will be equipped with sensors analyzing road traffic, such as: Doppler radar, lidar, acoustic probe, RGB camera, Bluetooth receiver. Due to the fact that changing weather conditions, such as: storms, blizzards, fog, black ice, are also a big risk on the road. A weather station will be installed in each sign, analyzing the current weather conditions around the sign. As a result, the resolution of weather measurements will be very high. The proposed approach to traffic analysis is based on the principles of multimodality, thanks to which it is possible to supplement each of the individual methods with a different one in a place where it better serves its purpose. Such a case can be observed e.g. at night, where standard vision cameras mainly capture car lights. The use of a lidar device in such conditions allows for proper detection of most vehicles. In the next chapter, individual modalities used in the conducted research will be presented.",Local,Poland,PL,Gdansk,Local Government,Economic affairs,Transport,Pilot,2019,,"Analysis, monitoring and regulatory research",Monitoring policy implementation,No,No,Artificial Intelligence,G2C,x,x,x,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/mapa-innowacji,Learning,Machine learning,Computer vision,,,,20/11/2023

For a month and a half, the Catalan government used Citibeats. This text-analysis software used machine-learning algorithms to collect and analyze around 12,000 tweets that spoke about the STEM disciplines in Catalonia. One of the insights the authorities said that they had gained was that women were more responsive to messages about natural sciences than about technology, according to the Catalan government’s PR. The authorities then used that and other insights to “optimize their strategy and propose new initiatives” to make young people interested in the STEM disciplines. The project was part of SmartCAT, the Catalan government’s strategy to become a smart region (as noted in this chapter, regional governments in Spain have a high degree of autonomy to develop their policies). The SmartCAT director said the software had allowed them “to evaluate in a more objective way the impact of the (government’s) initiatives” to make people interested in science and technology. Citibeats, developed by Social Coin, a Barcelona-based start-up, was also used in December 2017 by the Barcelona municipality to gather people’s attitudes towards public transport and mobility in the city by analyzing around 30,000 comments by more than 15,000 people. In a case study of this project, Citibeats spoke of “citizens as sensors”. In the two cases described above, and while the authorities praise the software’s ability to gather and analyze thousands of online comments (something it would take much more time and money to do using traditional survey methods), it’s not clear how representative those samples are and how valid the conclusions might be; and there doesn’t seem to be any information on how those analyses then influenced public policy.

PSTW-420,Algorithmic school registrations,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/belgium/,"In many Belgian cities, there are problems when registering children for schools, especially when a lot of parents want to register their children at the same school. This has led to parents spending several nights in tents outside schools so that they can be the first to register their children. In response to this situation, which was considered unfair, several cities started organizing school registration via a central online system that uses an algorithm to decide in which school a child can be registered. In the system for primary schools, that is used in Leuven, a city east of Brussels, a number of variables are taken into account. On the basis of the answers given by the parents to a series of questions relating to the education level of the mother and whether or not the student receives a grant, students are then divided into ‘indicator students’ and ‘non-indicator students’. An indicator student is a student who is defined as having fewer life chances and is based upon the level of education of the mother and if the student is eligible for an education allowance. Further categorization happens on the basis of two criteria: distance from home to school and preference of school. The schools can decide how much weight they assign to distance and preference i.e. between 30%, 50%, or 70% for each (Meldjeaan, 2020). This weight can differ between cities, for instance, in Antwerp the schools have to assign a minimum of 50% to the distance criterium. For secondary schools, some cities also use an online registration system, which uses an algorithm to decide which school the child will go to. However, the system is not the same as for primary schools. As not every municipality has a secondary school, the distance criterium is considered discriminatory and, therefore, it is not taken up (Dierickx and Berlanger, 2019). The system does take into account priority students (i.e., children of the staff of the school) and indicator-students (see above). The algorithm works randomly on the basis of the first choice in three rounds (Aanmelden school, 2020). As the system does not take distance into account, this has led to situations where students from Brussels took up places in Flemish secondary schools outside of Brussels, and children, living close to the school not getting in and having to be registered in schools much farther away (Dierickx and Berlanger, 2019).",Local,Belgium,BE,Municipality of Leuven,Local Government,Education,Pre-primary and primary education.,Implemented,2020,,Public services and engagement,Service integration (various),No,No,Artificial Intelligence,G2C,x,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/belgium/,Reasoning,Automated reasoning,Planning and Scheduling,,,,20/11/2023

PSTW-424,The Youth Guarantee Support System (YGSS) to identifying young people not in education or employment,https://tooelu.ee/et,"Since 2018, municipal governments in Estonia have been able to use a tool called The Youth Guarantee Support System (YGSS) (Mis on noortegarantii tugisüsteem? – Tööelu.ee o. J.). This tool helps case managers (social workers, child protection officers, youth workers, etc.) identify young people aged 16-26 who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). It is used to support them when they need to return to education or enter the labor market. Case managers of the Youth Guarantee Support System or the municipal government employees can see information about young people living in their specific locality. However, up until now, not all of the municipalities have joined the program. In order to join, the municipal governments have to send an application to the Municipal Government Information System for Social Services and Benefits (STAR). The case managers or municipal government employees are then shown a list in the STAR system of all the NEET youth who are registered as residents in a specific municipal area and who – according to other registry data – need help. This information is based on data from nine different registries, creating, therefore, a very comprehensive dataset that includes information on the young person’s address, email, phone number, educational background, and if they studied in Estonian or Russian. Young people have the right to forbid the analysis by a case manager, and in cases where the data is processed, young people must give their consent.  The case manager then contacts the young people identified by the system and a letter or an SMS is sent to each person asking them to complete a survey. The Youth Guarantee Support System Request is automatically triggered twice a year (15.03 and 15.10).",National,Estonia,EE,Various municipalities in Estonia,Local Government,Social protection,Unemployment.,Implemented,2018,,"Analysis, monitoring and regulatory research",Information analysis processes,No,No,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,,,,,,,x,,,x,,,,,,,,,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/estonia/,Reasoning,Knowledge representation,Automated reasoning,,,,20/11/2023

Costa Rica is also involved in the project by allowing access to its medical billing database (to look at clinical/socio-economic data not included in EHIF databases). The pilot was officially launched in January 2017. Throughout the pilot, family practitioners joined a series of webinars, led by the local pilot coordinator (World Bank consultant), to reinforce and refresh the initial training. This solution contributes to the empowerment of primary care and also helps find the best algorithm to predict which patients with selected diagnoses are likely to be admitted to the hospital. The solution first identifies certain medical conditions/diagnoses in the EHIF’s medical invoice data- base. It then provides a practical model for family physicians to predict which patients are more likely to be admitted to the hospital or suffer other health problems.

PSTW-428,Automatic identification of individual risk factors in social care and healthcare,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/finland/,"In October 2019, the Japanese multinational IT service provider, Fujitsu, announced that it was developing an AI solution for South Karelia’s social care and healthcare district (known by its Finnish acronym Eksote). The project employs machine learning methods with the aim of helping Eksote identify factors underlying social exclusion of young adults, as well as predicting associated risks. With the predictive model, social and healthcare professionals will be provided an overview of risk factors. According to Fujitsu’s press release, the model identifies some 90% of young adults susceptible to social exclusion. In practical terms, the model that is being used is derived from pseudonymized data taken from the use of Eksote’s services by young adults, and it uses this data to predict social exclusion outcomes defined by Eksote’s professionals. According to Eksote, the legislation on the secondary and combined use of healthcare data makes it possible to use only non-identifiable, pseudonymized data. This means that Fujitsu’s model cannot be used to identify individual young adults considered to be at risk of social exclusion; rather, the model produces a list of risk factors on a general level. The next step in the project is to examine whether it is possible, under the current legislation, to set up a consent-based system: a client’s consent would be asked for before using the predictive model on their individual data when they, for example, have an appointment with a social care or healthcare professional.

The aim was to identify problems early on, so that an intervention could be made and support provided to families sooner rather than later. Much like in the 2019 project on young adults and social exclusion, this model was based on explicitly defined undesired “endpoints”: low-grade averages, disciplinary interventions at school, high-class non-attendance figures, being taken into custody, acceptance into psychiatric care, and substance abuse. The model made use of data gathered from the IT systems of maternity clinics, kindergartens, schools, healthcare, and mental healthcare providers, as well as social services – e.g., it combined data from different administrative branches, namely social care, healthcare, and education. The outcome was the identification of a total of 1340 risk factors, ranging from bad teeth in children, to parents missing maternity clinic appointments, to the child’s siblings bullying others at school. These examples also give an idea of the kinds of data that were employed when making predictions.

The ambitions are multiple and transversal: from the attempt to ""export"" knowledge, techniques, and solutions across disciplines (for example from omics to legal data mining) to the combination of protocols and software to automate the pseudonymization of texts or to the creation of innovative tools for querying legal materials through their automatic annotation to the construction of prediction tools based on data science and Intelligence Artificial, to the attempt to offer understandable explanations on the functioning of the tools produced / used adapting them to the needs / capabilities of the different end users. ? ?All these steps are obviously articulated in full coherence with the corresponding regulatory and ethical framework, convinced that the regulatory and ethical profiles in research are central and go beyond mere adherence to the rules. ?",Regional,Italy,IT,"Tribunal of Pisa (and EMbeDS, KDD Lab)",Local Government,Public order and safety,Law courts,In development,2021,,Internal management,Internal primary processes,No,No,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,,,,,,,x,,,x,,,,,,,,,https://www.lanazione.it/pisa/cronaca/la-giustizia-diventa-predittiva-con-l-intelligenza-artificiale-della-scuola-sant-anna-1.6390186,Learning,Machine learning,Searching,,,,20/11/2023

XLAW is software that uses probabilistic, machine learning-powered solution for trends and pattern discovery in crimes. This implies that one can deduce — or more accurately, induce — how criminal behavior will unfold, before it has happened, by intelligent analysis of the criminal history of a location over time. Lombardo claims to have done this by carefully analyzing 20 years of data and also by calling on his experience in the field. As a result, thanks to XLAW, law enforcement officials can be alerted and deployed on the scene before a crime has even happened. At the same time, XLAW provides police officers with details as precise as “genre, height, citizenship, distinguishing features, and biometrics” of a potential suspect. XLAW has a strong predictive component to it.

The system has been upgraded since its introduction and that it now includes AI, ADM, and machine learning capabilities. For example, citizens can use ADM to learn their social rights and see a prediction of benefit payments so that they can make an informed evaluation and calculation before applying for social benefits. Furthermore, the application processes for several social rights/benefits is fully automated, e.g., to research previous decisions related to social benefits and to see new (informative) ones for particular applicants. E-sociala can also detect people from the same family and access their financial information, thereby simplifying the process for social workers. The goal is to further automate the process so that the system can create a full “social rights profile” for every applicant. The system will then be able to see what benefits a particular citizen is eligible for, for how long, and for what amount of money.

A dataset from a higher education institution is used to build classification models to predict academic performance of students. The dataset includes information known at the time of student’s enrollment – academic path, demographics and social-economic factors. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there’s a strong imbalance towards one of the classes. Algorithms to promote class balancing with synthetic oversampling are tested, and classification models are trained and evaluated, both with standard machine learning algorithms and state of the art boosting algorithms. Our results show that boosting algorithms respond better to the specific classification task than standard methods.

The platform, accessible via credentials, monitors information flows from Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia and Google Trends in real time. The platform allows the collection, analysis, aggregation and display of data extracted from different sources. This is possible thanks to the construction of the platform on three different levels (layers): the Data layer, the Analysis layer and the Visualization layer. The Data layer constantly collects raw data from the web and social media, pre-processes them through an initial screening and an initial cleaning of the raw data, obtained through the relative Application Programmer Interface, API: Twitter API, Reddit API, Google Trends API. To collect the data, keyword filters were used, created and validated through a structured framework, on the basis of recurrence and relevance criteria (6). The Analysis layer has the function of analyzing the processed and cleaned data through the generation of graphs, thus making the extracted data understandable and relating them to each other. The processes that allow the geolocalization of tweets take place on this layer, and two processes based on machine learning algorithms: Influencer analysis and Early-signal detection: Influencer analysis makes it possible to identify the most influential and most active users in the conversation about vaccines on Twitter, with the aim of monitoring the crucial ""nodes"" of the communities involved, both in vaccine-friendly communities and in the no vax community; Early-signal detection allows the interception of users who use new hashtags, therefore users new to the topic of vaccines. The hashtag (created by inserting the # key in front of the desired word or phrase, for example, #vaccini or #iononmivaccino) is a tool that serves as a thematic aggregator on some social networks and was introduced by Twitter as a keyword signal and to draw users' attention to some particular words or themes.

There are still many questions open about the concept of digital identity. RvIG recently organized an internal blockchain workshop. One of the most appealing examples of 'identity in the blockchain' that came up was the do-it-yourself marriage. For the conclusion of a marriage, three parties are now needed: the two partners who decide to marry and the registrar of the civil registry who closes the marriage. The civil registrar's role is that of the 'third party that creates trust and can conclude the agreement after checking.' The nature of the blockchain means that this 'third party' is in some cases superfluous. In theory, this could also apply to a marriage: via the blockchain, the identity and intention of the two partners can be checked and verified via smart contracts and the decentralized databases.

If any of the organizations involved had an incentive to manipulate the attendance numbers, a paper attendee list is very susceptible to fraud. Blockchain technology can offer a solution to this problem with the development of the Self Sovereign Attendance App. With this app, based on IOTA, people can check in on a decentralized blockchain, which is immutable, transparent and cryptographically protected, so that only the authorized parties can access and see attendee data. The proof of concept was successful, and BlockchainLab is continuing to develop the pilot building prototypes for the production app. With this solution, it has been shown how a blockchain-enabled solution can improve the safety, trust and fairness for different groups of users and organisations.

Biological diversity is closely related to the existence of habitat features that meet the requirements of different taxonomic groups. Single groups in most cases show individual criteria. Thus, a monitoring of habitat features must be tailored to a distinct set of target groups. Satellite data, today, are not (yet) able to detect single individual plants or insects. But, they are capable of mapping defined habitat features at large spatial scales that provide information about the nature value of single fields or landscapes. The overall goal of the project is the setup of an area-wide, spatially explicit trend monitoring at national level for the quantitative analysis of landscape structure and agricultural land-use intensity within these landscapes. For this, a set of indicators will be established that covers a variety of aspects at landscape (landscape structure, landscape elements) and field level (management intensity) in cropland and grassland areas. The Sentinel earth observation satellites (i.e. Sentinel-1 and -2) of the Copernicus-program from European Space Agency (ESA) provide the basis for this spatial modelling approach in a nation-wide monitoring project.",National,Germany,DE,Thünen-Institut ,Central-Government,Environmental protection,R&D environmental protection.,Pilot,2019,2024,"Analysis, monitoring and regulatory research",Information analysis processes,No,No,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,,,,,,,x,,,,x,,,,,,,,"Bendszusn, R.

This also includes intensifying a person-based approach to combating this area. For this reason, the risk assessment tool RADAR-rechts, i.e. Rule-based analysis of potentially destructive offenders for assessing the acute risk of committing a life-threatening, right-wing motivated violent crime, was developed in the BKA from March 2020 and has been in use since 10.05.2022. The aim of the new instrument is to prioritise persons known to the police from the right-wing spectrum (especially dangerous and relevant persons) with regard to the risk of committing a specifically life-threatening right-wing-motivated act of violence. RADAR-rechts thus enables a resource-oriented optimisation of risk management processes, including the identification of such persons who must be subjected to an individual risk analysis.

The person is then traced on other cameras to get a more complete picture of the route he or she took and to detect crimes that might have been committed. The system can also help search for lost children and solve bicycle theft more easily. Another goal functionality is the generation of live alerts. For instance, at the beginning and end of the school day, trucks are not permitted to drive near schools. If a truck is spotted driving through an area it is not allowed to, the system sends an alert to the police. Lastly, the system collects statistical information to support policy.

However, it does not actually predict the likelihood of criminality but rather the likelihood of a child being registered on the police system in relation to a crime. ProKid utilizes police data from criminal fact and criminal opinion databases to formulate its risk assessments. Being assessed as 'at risk' by ProKid can have significant consequences for children and their families, potentially leading to separation and involvement with youth care and child abuse protection services. The assessments have been found to be incorrect and erroneous in a significant number of cases. A Ministry of Security and Justice evaluation revealed that one-third of the assessed children had their risk levels mis-assigned due to errors or reports based on irrelevant incidents.

PSTW-1310,Participa.gov – Digital Public Participation Platform,https://participa.gov.pt/,"Instruments for public participation make it possible to encourage collaborative discussion between decision-makers and stakeholders, creating the ideal environment for obtaining more thoughtful and equitable decisions, avoiding institutional suspicion, increasing the likelihood of consensus, and consequently increasing the success of the policies themselves. During the 2019 Simplex program, a national flagship initiative based on citizen engagement and co-creation for the simplification and modernization of the public sector, the idea came up and AMA delivered.

Participa.GOV is exactly that – a one-stop-shop platform where citizens can present their proposals and decide through their votes on all relevant initiatives for their lives – From the national budget to a GovTech contest or their children’s school initiatives, everything is possible at Participa.gov. Simply put, public entities launch a challenge, based on a set of rules predefined at the back office, and citizens present their proposals and then decide through their voting. A school might want its students to vote on the launch a social responsibility project, or the central government might launch a national participatory budgeting, or we can even have the NHS wanting to launch a restricted and exclusive participatory, process, available only to its workers – all of it is possible and works under the same rules. And better yet? The look and feel of the front office will always be the same.

When developing participa.gov we took into account two major factors:

1. The need to be customizable, because each entity has its own idiosyncrasies and target audiences and because each initiative is different.
2. The need to be safe, secure, and transparent because we know that the biggest challenge of any participatory system is related to trust factors.

The Participa.gov platform was therefore built using highly secure eID mechanisms and blockchain technology, ensuring security, auditing, and transparency in the process from start to finish. Because data is protected by cryptography and thus immutable, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies make it possible to overcome corruption and ensure there is no intervention from malicious outside players. Secure digital identity mechanisms add an extra layer of security and, in the case of the Portuguese eID ecosystem, it allows the participants' scope to be defined based on the attributes available in the Portuguese digital identity: age, address, professional attributes, and so on.

The Participa.gov portal was created with the belief that digital technologies, when combined with public participation tools, can play an important role in connecting citizens to democracy. And, in this new era of digital democracy, we want Participa.gov to become the single national platform for all public participatory processes, involving more citizens in public decision-making every day.",National,Portugal,PT,AMA (Agência para a Modernização Administrativa),Central-Government,General public services,"Executive and legislative organs, financial and fiscal affairs, external affairs.",Implemented,2021,,Public services and engagement,Governance and voting ,No,No,Blockchain,G2C,x,x,x,,,x,,,,,,,,,x,x,x,x,https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/participa-gov/,,,,,,,21/08/2023

of an event. The tool is free to use for all relevant stakeholders, such as event organisers, regions, municipalities,
destinations, property owners, tour operators, the hotel and restaurant industry, students, etc.
The tool is characterised by its user-friendliness, as users are simply required to input a series of figures, they
have knowledge of, or can make educated guesses about. These include key figures about the magnitude of
the event (such as on the expected number of participants or the expected number of foreign participants),
information on participants’ expected accommodation and means of transportation, costs of tickets,
sponsorships, and even the residents’ attitude towards the event.
After receiving the data, the tool compiles a report estimating economic, environmental and social impacts, to
be potentially used by organisers to inform negotiations with destination managers, motivate grant applications,
attract sponsors, or any other activity in connection with the event. Therefore, the tool allows tourism
stakeholders to organise events with greater professionalism thanks to the possibility of informing discussions

dashboards are not accessible to the public as they contain sensitive data, while others are published through
publicly accessible dashboards, providing for example parking availability forecasts, which is calculated through
machine learning techniques. Data sharing amongst the parties is regulated through a combination of contractual
obligations for service operators and
mutual data sharing agreements with

PSTW-1635,ACCUDIRE - export tracking based on blockchain,https://accudire.eu/,"The DLT use case was conducted in July 2021 and presented two months later in Trieste during the conference ""Italy Smart Export"". The ""Pilot 1.0"" was a shipment from Italy to Turkey with a complete digitisation of the logistics documentation and interoperability between public and private subjects involved. It was the first fully digital shipment exploiting blockchain technology in Italy and Europe and it involved the following players: Benetton Group (exporting company), Port of Trieste (customs and place of departure for the Ro-Ro shipment), ADM (the Italian Customs Agency which gave a quality check about the correctness of the process), a global freight forwarder and a Turkish Import Company. The shipment has been done using the ACCUDIRE platform and creating an e-CMR (Electronic Consignment Note for road transportation). The identities of the subjects involved have been verified through two-factor authentication and their signatures have been geolocated and saved on blockchain, interoperating with AIDA (ADM's software) and sending the pre-arrival notification of goods to the PCS (Port Community Systems). Specifically, the e-CMR document needs 3 signatures (sender, carrier and receiver) and ACCUDIRE saves on blockchain these signatures (including geolocation, identity and all other relevant information) in order to guarantee immutability, traceability and security of the shipping related information. Blockchain used is a permissioned Hyper Ledger Fabric supplied by TrustedChain with nodes all in Italy at AgID (Agency for Digital Italy) qualified entities (Trust Service Providers, according to the eIDAS-regulation).

The pilot has been inserted also as a use case of the DTLF and mentioned in the Subgroup 1 (Paperless Transport) of the e-FTI (Electronic Freight Transport Information) discussions, which is regularising and formalising digital processes related to the transport of goods across Europe. Additionally, ACCUDIRE is part of the European Horizon 2020 TRICK project, which aims at supporting SMEs operating in fashion and food industries in the adoption, tracing and demonstration of sustainable approaches by means of Blockchain.

The impact of the use case has been relevant for Italy and Europe. The pilot represents the first shipment with fully digitised documents and processes with blockchain, simplifying all the procedures and especially the interoperability between public and private players involved. ACCUDIRE is now an innovative platform that allows Large and SMEs involved in global supply chains in the complete digitisation of processes and documentation through a paperless and eco-friendly approach, preserving ""Made in"" and protecting products against counterfeiting. Thanks to ACCUDIRE, companies can reduce costs, maximise margins, decrease waste and work in synergy with the many other actors involved along the chain. In addition, ACCUDIRE allows a better connection between trade and trade finance, simplifying the flow of financial information and thus the payment of the goods and the dialogue between banks and firms.",National,Italy,IT,Agenzia delle dogane e dei Monopoli (ADM),Central-Government,Economic affairs,"General economic, commercial and labour affair",Pilot,2021,2021,Public services and engagement,Tracking of goods and assets along the supply chain ,Yes,No,Blockchain,G2B,x,,,,x,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSISANDCOLLAB/European+Blockchain+Sandbox+announces+the+selected+projects+for+the+first+cohort#EuropeanBlockchainSandboxannouncestheselectedprojectsforthefirstcohort-ACCUDIR,,,,,,,21/09/2023

We focus on the issue of digital frugality, in the context of the environmental objectives of the Paris Agreement and the European infrastructure for the observation of the carbon cycle, called ICOS.

Our use case consists of a blockchain-based tool for collecting, processing and displaying CO2 concentrations from sensors deployed in urban areas. A network of sensors collects raw climatic data and sends it to a laboratory (typically one for each urban area) that treats this data in order to arrive at a temporal series of CO2 concentrations for each sensor. The treated data is then made public through a web dashboard, and the treatment process is notarised via calls to smart contracts on the blockchain. Our tool relies on non-energy consuming technologies such as proof-of-stake and Byzantine fault tolerance, which can reduce the consumption of traditional blockchains (i.e., those based on proof-of-work) by three orders of magnitude.

Notarisation is done by anchoring (i.e., storing the hashes of data on the blockchain to ensure data's integrity). The anchoring allows the laboratories (or other third parties) to audit each other by reproducing the treatment process and checking data's integrity against the hashes stored on the blockchain. The ultimate goal is to provide trust on the climatic data and its treatment to the public.

AI technology is called a copilot because it acts as a smart helper for staff, supporting them in their day-to-day work, while staff members are the pilots who guide them. During phase 1, teams working in adult social care will use the emerging technology to review care packages and help them decide if someone who needs support living at home is receiving the right level of care. They will also use AI to answer more simple and straightforward enquiries from the public and professionals, so they can focus on dealing with queries which need their expertise.

TPOs are facilitative agencies that promote and stimulate trade by providing information, linkages, technical advice, marketing and policy advocacy. Answering ‘trade cases’ is one of the core business activities of FIT. A ‘trade case’ is a question from a Flemish company about a foreign market, that concerns the services of FIT, for example inquiries about the size or customs of a local market, potential foreign business partners, trade regulations or barriers, subsidies or market opportunities. The existing digital tools (before the AI adoption) for answering trade cases consisted of Microsoft Dynamics as a CRM software, used for receiving, assigning and answering incoming questions, and Microsoft SharePoint as a collaborative document management and storage system, used for storing relevant information on local markets, partners and regulations, and for storing documents drawn up for previous cases. The studied algorithm is aimed at partly automating the process of answering trade cases. Using natural language processing, trained on a large dataset of past trade questions and answers, the algorithm was designed to retrieve past answers to frequently-asked routine questions. It acts as an AI-powered search engine, not just comparing individual words, but interpreting the entire body of the question to find the most relevant answer.

Alta Novella had belonged to Borgo d’Anaunia Municipality since the 1960s, but then it was abandoned because of the absence of a dam. When production is low, running and maintaining a hydropower plant becomes an expensive burden. Indeed, the main motivation for setting up a data center at the municipal hydropower plant was economic. The municipality doesn’t actually mine or trade bitcoin. Alps Blockchain, the Italian tech company that set up the mining farm at Alta Novella and carries out maintenance, simply purchases the computing power produced by the facility’s mining farm for at least 35% more than what the government pays for its energy. Alps Blockchain sells the computing power purchased from the facility to bitcoin mining pools around the world. Alta Novella is one of 18 hydropower plants in northern Italy that now house a mining farm set up by Alps Blockchain. The company aims to double that number by the end of the year.

All regulated products will have DPPs. This will ensure that supply chains become more circular and that consumers are aware of the environmental impacts of their purchases.

EU’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation as well as the Battery Regulation, have outlined the adoption of DPPs with the aim to make durable and repairable products ‘the norm’ in the EU’s single market.

For DPPs to succeed, third-party verification of data is key to ensure transparency across a wide range of materials and products. This regulatory framework presents big opportunities for the introduction of blockchain-related technologies that ensure a chain of trust across supply chains in Europe and beyond. As a member of the Product Circularity Data Sheets (PCDS) Initiative which is led by the Ministry of Economy of Luxembourg and supported by major international industry leaders, Compellio has taken concrete steps to contribute to Europe’s Green & Digital transition by developing a new Digital Product Passport solution for the Circular Economy that enables out-of-the-box compliance with the upcoming ISO 59040 PCDS standard.
Moreover, the European Commission has selected Compellio’s collaborative project with Uni Systems, as part of the first 20 use cases of the EU Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox.

Equilibrium group has been selected as one of the use cases for the inaugural cohort of the European Blockchain Sandbox. Through Membrane Finance, Equilibrium Group has tokenized the euro fiat currency by creating a fully regulated e-money version called EUROe. EUROe can be used for any payment on blockchain networks.

EUROe is an EU-based stablecoin and payment network regulated as an electronic money institution in the European Union. Based in Finland, as an European hub for technology & regulatory stability.

Moreover, Equilibrium Group is exploring the regulatory environment for tokenizing shares of unlisted companies, which would allow companies to use DLT-based technologies to maintain their share registries. DLT-based technologies already constitute the cheapest and fastest way to issue, maintain and use digital assets, driving efficiency gains. Furthermore, DLT-based technologies are inherently standardized, allowing issued assets to smoothly interoperate with other services deployed on the platform, with minimal integration related overhead.

Additionally, Equilibrium Group will explore the tokenization of other real-world assets and the creation of a DLT-based regulated marketplace, which entails personal data processing and would require novel digital identity solutions (e.g., zero-knowledge proof-based KYC). This work may lead to a new RWA token standard.

However, the regulatory framework/landscape regarding the tokenization of real world assets in the EU is still unclear and without many precedents. Also, once a tokenized asset has been created, there are regulatory uncertainties as to where this asset can be transacted with and what are the rights and/or obligations for all relevant parties.

This process will begin with an ""initial audit to evaluate the heritage assets to determine their location, typology, state of conservation, mobility and any relevant report on the asset."" Subsequently, after completing the audit, a certification of ownership and authorship of these assets will be carried out, incorporating systems to protect them, such as blockchain technology; or what is the same, ""a built-in geolocation chip to prevent theft, fraud and forgery.""

The project was launched as a pilot in the Julio Romero de Torres Museum in 2021 and will now be extended to more assets of the municipal Heritage after the granting, by the Ministry of Territorial Policy, of 1.19 million euros from the Next funds Generation to the City Council of Cordoba for four projects linked to digitalization and cybersecurity.

This certification is necessary, according to the project report, because ""there is no tool that allows quick uploading and access to the ownership data of a certified asset on a technological platform that also complies with a set of anti-fraud measures."" and allows you to extract collective and individualized statistics and metrics from the assets.""

The document emphasizes that blockchain technology could revolutionize the art industry, ""resolving issues such as provenance, copyright, ownership of the work, its traceability and other current problems."" All of this in a context in which in the art and heritage market, great challenges are detected to be resolved, such as avoiding fraud, ""ensuring the authorship and origin of the art works"" .

The objective is to certify and protect all the authenticity of the heritage through blockchain technology, which is unhackable and secure. 

The first step to carry out the project is to work with the museum management to identify all the heritage archives that can be stored in blockchain, to which a label will be incorporated to make a secure documentary trace and we will now add sensors, which have two functions: geolocation and an accelerometer. With all this, it will be known, for example, if someone steals a painting, because it will be alerted about the location of each work of art from Cordoba's heritage in real time, with a maximum of about 2,000 pieces.

The objective of the Circular Trust project is to increase the transparency and reduce the costs of the recycling process while minimizing the environmental impact.

All players who participate in one way or another in the recycling process will be able to access the system data and improve information transactions. Thus, public administrations, local entities, operators, recyclers and other organizations will have quality information on real-time monitoring of waste selection, collection and recycling.

Proposals like this are now key in the strategies of companies and public administrations, even more so taking into account that around 2.5 billion tons of waste are generated annually in the EU, which requires adequate management to reduce its impact on the environment. Since CircularTrust began operating in 2020, hundreds of daily transactions have been recorded associated with the removal of waste in more than 90 sorting plants in Spain, as well as the transfer of waste to more than 70 approved recycling facilities, with monitoring. of the entire process in real time. During the first half of 2022, an average of 4,725 withdrawals and around 18,000 monthly transactions have been processed, which have been immutably recorded in the blockchain network.

As this project demonstrates, blockchain offers the possibility of continuing to take steps to improve the recycling process, offering greater control of information thanks to the establishment of smart contracts, the generation of documentary evidence or automation or payments, among others. . In this way, this technology not only results in greater transparency, but also in greater efficiency.

A challenge facing the current education system is its tendency to overlook the diverse achievements of learners, particularly when it comes to micro-credentials. Despite learners demonstrating a range of valuable skills and interests by completing courses, programmes or trainings, their accomplishments are often unnoticed. This lack of recognition not only hampers learners' ability to showcase their competencies but also limits their opportunities for admission to relevant programs, especially within the framework of European mobility. Micro-credentials, owned by the learner, provide a unique opportunity for individuals to showcase their skills in a portable and shareable format. Whether as standalone achievements or combined into comprehensive bundles, micro-credentials offer a dynamic representation of an individual's capabilities.  When leveraging EBSI, this opportunity transforms into a powerful catalyst for recognising and valuing individual achievements. It will allow life-long learners to ensure that their educational- and professional-gained skills, represented as micro-credentials, can be shared and recognised across borders and institutions. A team of education ministries and universities across Europe envision this project as a way to reshape the learning environment in Europe and demonstrate how learners can benefit from micro-credentials.

PSTW-1971,Vocational Education & Training,https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSI/Vocational+Education+and+Training,"A consortium of Government ministries, federal and research institutes, public companies, and universities are pioneering the future of vocational education and training in Europe with EBSI by facilitating the issuance, acceptance, and recognition of all types of vocational educational and training certifications across borders.  Vocational education and training (VET) systems in Europe are not centrally governed but rather rely on a well-developed network of VET stakeholders. The social partners that govern these networks are employers and trade unions, structured as chambers, committees, and councils.

However, the way these social partners communicate and exchange information in Europe still faces challenges at administrative and regulatory levels, especially with the issuance, acceptance, and verification of paper or digital vocational education credentials. This is because vocational education qualifications in Europe lack administrative processes and regulatory implementation - including the use of standardised data models. This gap affects all levels of the process, resulting in a high number of steps, prolonged timeframes, shared and ambiguous responsibilities, or a reliance on intermediary third parties. Web3 allows a streamlined digital verification process for learners' affiliations and credentials without a reliance on intermediaries, helping the Europe wide VET system strengthen the acceptance and popularity of vocational verifiable credentials while upholding user information privacy. This is specifically relevant when employers (verifiers) require professional and specific skills from the applicants: a reliable authentication process for vocational skillsets opens up novel career paths for the European vocational workforce.

In the labour market, proving professional experience and qualifications to employers remains a complicated process, especially at the European level. Professionals applying to national or cross-border work often have to provide proof of professional skill or experience via physical (paper) documents, digitally signed PDFs or self-written CVs. HR departments can either trust the authenticity of the documents or dedicate time and effort to phone back previous employers for verification. Even in the best case, there is no method to authenticate if the trusted document is really linked to the said individual. This means current processes are time-consuming and fraud-susceptible.

Called ""quadratic funding,"" the mechanism aims to fairly account for both public and private preferences when allocating limited budget resources. A coalition of organisations including BlockSplit, Funding the Commons, Gitcoin, and the City of Split launched the Municipal Quadratic Funding Initiative in September 2023. The project goals include implementing quadratic funding for prioritizing public spending, utilizing web3 tools to increase transparency and participation, and demonstrating the potential of these technologies to improve legacy processes. The partners believe that the transparency and configurability of blockchain systems make them well-suited to quadratic funding applications. Quadratic funding mathematically accounts for the intensity of demand for public goods. Groups can create projects which individuals can support financially. The amount of money ultimately directed to each proposal is based on the square of support received. This means that projects attracting larger numbers of smaller contributions can compete with those receiving fewer large donations. In this way, quadratic funding aims to reflect both willingness to pay and breadth of support in funding decisions. It attempts to break tendency towards corruption where influential groups lobby for their niche interests. The goal is a fairer allocation suited to the whole community's preferences. The initiative will build on open source quadratic funding infrastructure already deployed for other uses like funding public goods on Ethereum. Practical web3 tools can help teadministration manage funding rounds and disburse awards.  A small experiment funding neighborhood improvements in Croatia's second largest city may pioneer a better way to budget public money.

A total of more than 75 sensors and five high-performance computers were installed on the motorway, on the country road and at an urban intersection and networked with high-performance fibre optic and radio technologies. With the built-in air conditioning and the robust peripheral electrics/electronics, the high-performance computers are able to process the raw sensor data – a total of approx. 20 Gbps – in a decentralised manner and in real time. The AI-based algorithms for traffic detection and the mapping of digital twins were further researched and further developed. This applies to the entire software chain of the digital twin - the recognition of anonymized traffic objects from the raw data, the temporal tracking and assignment of individual objects, the synchronization and fusion of data from different sensor sources and modalities, and the distribution of the digital twins via a service interface. The live operation from selected stations was presented to the general public with the help of video feeds and virtual environments at the project project.

The BIM model is developed and updated throughout the project phases, from conceptual design to detailed design and for the needs of the construction itself. The development of the BIM model is also in line with project cost management based on linking PBoQ (priced bill of quantities) with individual BIM building blocks according to the design phase. With the complexity of the BIM model and the increasing number of building blocks, the organisation of the BIM model is necessary for the management of the BoQ, which is achieved with an appropriate Model Breakdown Structure (MBS).

The swarms will be managed by decentralised orchestration agents with blockchain-based trusted solutions, state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms, and privacy-preserving data analytics.  This demonstrator will be based on the FUELICS parking occupancy, battery-operated sensor that offers parking and anti-parking roadside services. The sensor is calibrated at the location of each installation to measure the earth magnetic flux in a 3D ellipsoid space around the sensor. Once this is registered at the edge of the sensors’ local storage, the device is able to detect the presence of large metallic objects above or in the vicinity of the sensor because their presence distorts the magnetic field. The sensor is able to detect this change and report a parking space occupancy event. However, in practice it is common for the magnetic field of the earth to randomly drift or even completely change which leads to the sensor reporting false positive or negative events and calling for its manual recalibration.  The goal of the demonstrator is to create an application that will combine the magnetic flux data of multiple sensors, and in the case of abnormal behaviour it will trigger the auto-calibration and reconfiguration of the sensors in an automated way. The aim is to develop an application that uses this network to depict changes of the earth’s magnetic field over time at planetary scale, as well as, using smaller localised sensor networks to study possible effects of local phenomena (e.g. an earthquake) at a particular location.
