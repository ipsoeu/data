    "Description": "As of 2020, the Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) makes use of algorithmic profiling of job seekers to increase the efficiency of its counseling process and the effectiveness of active labor market programs. Based on a statistical model of job seekers' prospects on the labor market, the system—that has become known as the AMS algorithm—is designed to classify clients of the AMS into three categories: those with high chances to find a job within half a year, those with mediocre prospects on the job market, and those clients with a bad outlook of employment in the next 2 years. Depending on the category a particular job seeker is classified under, they will be offered differing support in (re)entering the labor market  A coalition of civil society organizations started a campaign to rescind an algorithm used by Austria’s employment agency. The system has been declared illegal by the Austrian data protection agency.",

To do this, they compare the text of the files of the offer to the ones of the metadata of the components.

Informatie Vlaanderen use it to detect and categorise the incoming questions faster and more 'finely-meshed', and also integrate this 'finely-meshed' into the editorial management. In this way, the answers can be suggested more quickly, more adequately and also more 'automatically' to the answer provider, regardless of the chosen communication channel (oral or written). In essence, the project aims at two objectives: (1) the quicker and more efficient capturing and categorising of the question, and (2) the quicker and more efficient forwarding of the 'correctly captioned' question to the 'correct' answer provider with the 'correct' skills, whereby a valid and standardised answer (suggestion) is immediately sent along with it (so that the answer provider does not have to look up the intended answer script).",

The use of data had been considered as way to enhance existing inspection practices and optimize the scarce amount of inspectors. The predictive system developed uses a supervised machine learning method (logistic regression and XGBoost) to analyse various internal and external data from the Health Care Inspection Unit.

The optical satellite images from Sentinel 1 and 2 are analysed together with reference data of farmer fields, historical inspection logs and meteorological data from the Estonian Weather Service. This AI system is now regarded as one of the first AI applications used by the government in Estonia.

With risk-based management, GPs can identify patients with multiple chronic diseases on their list for whom additional prevention, counseling and monitoring would be most beneficial to their health and quality of life. If these patients are neglected by the GP teams, this can lead to serious problems, including unnecessary deterioration in health, which not only causes health damage but also unnecessary costs to the healthcare system (avoidable hospitalizations, duplication of examinations, etc.).The created solution finds the best algorithm for predicting which patients with selected diagnoses are likely to be hospitalized. In the solution, the EHIF database of medical bills first finds certain conditions / diagnoses to be included in the algorithm.",

    "Description": "The virtual assistant called ITI, created in collaboration with the Estonian start-up AlphaBlues, knows the population of Estonia, the size of the pay gap, average wages and consumer price changes, and many other things. Iti also assists the data provider, whose typical questions are related to activities in the electronic data submission portal and filling in questionnaires. If Iti does not know the answer, it will redirect the query based on its content to either the customer support specialist of the data provider or the user of the statistics. Iti has obtained its knowledge from the questions sent through online chats over one year and gets wiser with every query.  ITI helps to find information faster thus allowing the customer support of Statistics Estonia to focus on answering more complicated and detailed queries.",

    "Description": "The Tallinn transport Dep. started developing a machine vision application in autumn 2018 in collaboration with Sifr OU. The main objective of this application is to identify the traffic load within Tallinn, i.e. how many cars drive in and out of the city in a day in order to make city transport planning related decisions based on such data (e.g. parking issues, road construction, etc.). Three cameras were selected on intersections in Tallinn to train the application to count the vehicles passing by the cameras. The training of the application was a crucial process in developing the solution since there was no ready-made solution available that suited the circumstances of Tallinn. The result is an application that uses machine vision to count buses, cars, lorries and motorcycles and in the future hopefully also pedestrians, cyclists and like with a 70% accuracy on the traffic load in a certain area when previously there no such information available at all.",

Two cities involved (Tampere and Turku) carried out well-being surveys among its student populations, and - based on its results - clustered the students into the groups in need of different support. The study has discovered that factors such as reliability of the public transportation, and quality of the natural environment plays an important role in students’ well-being. Data retrieved from the study helped create a new cross-cutting public offering - a bot that would supply information about the topics that students found important. The uptake of the new service has been lackluster, leading the authorities to believe that only proactive marketing could change customers’ behaviour. Also it has been concluded that in order to pursue such projects further, municipalities need to develop user experience awareness and data analytics skills.",

The objective is to dynamically detect 2 to 5 new SMEs per month on the scale of Bourgogne Franche-Comté.\nExpected impacts in terms of digital transformation: an even more effective decentralized State action to support weakened companies.

    "Description": "France has authorised the use of surveillance cameras to monitor whether passengers on public transport are abiding by the requirement to wear masks. However, France’s data protection watchdog CNIL called out the practice, saying it was not governed by any legal framework and was therefore illegal. The authority began a three-month test of its software from French tech company Datakalab this week at the Chatelet-Les-Halles station in the heart of Paris, normally used by about 33 million passengers per year. Monitors will have access to a dashboard with the proportion of riders believed to be wearing masks. The plan was mask wearing mandatory in public transport from May 2019. The AI was regarded to be able to supplement enforcement agents in stations. Still, CNIL, the government body in charge of privacy, raised concerns that this type of technology carries a risk that the identity of the people being analyzed could be reconstructed.",

The objective of La Bonne Boite is to help jobseekers find job opportunities that are not published by employers (i.e. \"hidden vacancies\") and to predict which companies are most likely to hire in the near  future. La Bonne Boite is one of the most used job searching services in France and it is about to be further developed in order to target more specific types of jobseekers, like students, that are looking for part-time jobs. This search engine improves a jobseeker's chance of securing a job interview on the basis of spontaneous job applications. La Bonne Boite's computer code can be copied and used by others. There is also an Application Programming Interface (API) which enables the duplication of La Bonne Boite on other websites.",

Skala uses past experiences, such as the near-repeat theory. Once a week, Skala spits out forecasts of residential burglaries for police authorities in Bonn, Duisburg, Dusseldorf, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, and Cologne – maps showing residential districts with a high probability of burglary. The police use the forecasts to decide, for example, where to send more patrol cars and whether to personally advise the population in vulnerable areas on burglary protection. At the beginning of May 2018, NRW Minister of the Interior Herbert Reul announced that it would extend its deployment to the whole of North Rhine-Westphalia, initially to all main crime departments.",

    "Description": "In 2018, Irish Revenue Commissioners began investigating the potential of Artificial Intelligence to provide a more efficient, effective experience for customers using their telephony services. This resulted in the implementation of a Virtual Digital Agent (VDA) designed to focus on a subset of calls from the Irish taxpayer relating to tax clearance. 1) taxpayers contact Irish Revenue tax clearance customer support asking how to apply for tax clearance; 2) enquiring what their current tax clearance status is; 3) requesting more information on expired, refused & rescinded tax clearance applications as well as just looking for information on tax clearance itself.  Result is up to 50% of calls were handled from start to finish by the voicebot,  70% of first-time applicants engaged by voicebot submitting their application, 75% of tax clearance holders were able to retrieve their tax clearance access number (TCAN). Only in 10% of the calls, the calls were transferred to a human operator.",

    "Description": "Municipalities in Netherlands have been using the SyRi system to detect welfare fraud more effectively, developed by the Dutch government. It uses various risk indicators from existing governmental systems such as taxes, health insurance, residence, education and many more, to detect which addresses hold a higher risk of fraud or misuse of welfare benefits.  SyRi was developed in 2014 after multiple municipalities had been creating their own systems to detect fraud. The system does not make any decisions itself, but provides recommendations for civil servants to conduct further investigations. Various organisations have opposed the usage arguing it causes too many privacy infringements and is discriminatory towards the poor and vulnerable citizens. The lack of transparency on the inner working of the system and the inability of the people affected to get to know their data have been used, has been criticized as well. Following a court case, the Dutch court decided in early 2020 that the use of SyRi did not comply with Article 8 of the ECHR thus its usage has been cancelled.",

    "Description": "The Netherlands Ministry of Water and Infrastructure Management (RWS) operates a 24h incident management service. Traffic managers process real-time data from 15+ screens, with chances of an accident being missed. Traffic inspectors need to ensure they are optimally positioned in their deployment zone to minimize travel time to accident sites. For this, Data Science for Social Good has been working with Rijkswaterstaat to create a machine learning model using data from incidents recorded between 2012 to 2016, road characteristics, speed and flow traffic data and weather data. The model predicts within a given time window and road segment the probability of an accident. Overlaying this on a heatmap we are able to display to traffic managers the road sections with the highest likelihood of accidents and allow them to better allocate inspectors to road sections to patrol. The solution gives a 3 to 4 times improvement on a baseline, where traffic inspectors patrol random road segments.",

Through this experiment it is possible to translate the individual perceptions of many citizens about the habitability of cities into objective knowledge, reusable in urban planning.\nThe relevance and innovation of the project is based on applying information and communication technologies to different transversal fields of knowledge, which have their common denominator in the city.",

As a result, IoT sensor data enables ProRail to optimize train schedules and maintain equipment—two serious challenges for railway efficiency. To conduct preventative maintenance, ProRail uses a railway track monitoring system that collects data and monitors the state of the track infrastructure on various routes. Data can secure the physical environs as well. ProRail uses algorithms to determine when and where a trespasser might decide to walk on the track, for example.",

It provided twice as many revelations of cheating. The book check is done among students who state that they live away from home, since only students who do not live with their parents can get the loan back from grants. Lånekassen’s book check in 2018 included 25,000 students. 15,000 were picked out by Artificial Intelligence (machine learning), while 10,000 were picked out by random selection (control group). The results showed that Artificial Intelligence made it easier to find those who are not really living away from home, said the Loan Fund. 5.5% in the control group and 11.6% in the machine learning group did not pass the book check. It shows that the machine learning selection has been twice as effective as the random selection in finding students who have given us incorrect information about housing",

Since the MFA adopted machine learning and NLP to analyse and classify the content of these documents, it has been possible to find almost all relevant information on a given subject matter. The solution is also used to extract key information in reports and prepare summaries.\nIn the work on developing this solution, the MFA cooperated with the University of Oslo, which provided solutions for categorising the Norwegian language. The plan is to gradually expand the solution with information from archives and external research reports.",

Once users activate the app by entering a phone number and a code sent via SMS, they send a reference photo. Every so often the app sends an unscheduled request for a new photo to be sent within 20 minutes. The system checks both the person (using facial recognition) and the location, essentially replicating what would otherwise be a visit from a police officer. Non-quarantined people cannot sign up, as the app is connected to a database of telephone numbers belonging to those ordered into quarantine. The app also gives access to relevant health information and a hotline. The government intends to add more functionality to the app over time.",

The AI tool is developed by a local company. It allows for real-time information regarding the levels of attendance at beaches to be analysed in order to avoid crowds and minimise the risk of possible Covid-19 infections. This software works by using Artificial Intelligence sensors that are installed in streetlights. Then, virtual grids are created in which there is a maximum capacity for occupants.  The 3D volume of people entering and leaving these spaces is measured, as well as the amount of people entering the measurement grids. The results of the calculations are carried out in real time in order to warn citizens about means of occupancy (percentages and colours are used as visual warnings).",

The figures support its success: since the implementation of this tool a decade ago, the recurrence of attacks has decreased by 25% according to the latest data.

Spanish national police have adopted the VeriPol. The system was designed to be integrated into the existing Spanish National Police information system called SIDENPOL, allowing for easier use and integration into existing work practices. The database of police reports was made available for the researchers in order to train the AI system on. For this, 1122 reports were used, including 534 true and 588 false reports. VeriPol exploits a combination of Natural Language Processing and machine learning classification algorithms, capable of estimating the probability of false police reports with significant accuracy. In addition to that, the system also enables insights into the differences between false and true police reports.",

The automated decision making system is able to process applications for homecare, sickness benefits, unemployment benefits and taxes and has been regarded as a successful example for others to follow. Various other Swedish municipalities are exploring how to implement the Trelleborg model to gain access to the same kinds of benefits. As a result of the automation process, the waiting time for citizens on their welfare applications has been significantly reduced. It has been mentioned that many case handling times for people in economically vulnerable situations has been reduced from 10 days to 1 day, with all financial assistance decisions done within 24 hours. In addition, two employees in the Trelleborg administration could be allocated to spend more time on other, value adding tasks such as handling more complex cases.",

Tengai is one of the first interviewer robots developed with the aim to make the recruitment process less biased than traditional interview practices would do. The robot is adopted by the recruitment and staffing agency of the municipality, which has already made their recruitment processes less biased. The Tengai robot is the result of a collaboration between the municipality staff and the AI consultancy Furhat Robotics. After the Tengai robot was released, within a week, it was decided to adopt its services permanently. Tengai firstly identify candidates with the highest general performance score, in order to make a shortlist for future selections. The robot then conducts the interviews to assess the candidates by analysing their behaviours, problem-solving capacities and other skills. If needed, the robot is able to ask follow-up questions. The interviews are then analysed, combined with the competency scores.  The recruiters of the municipality will conduct the final interview with candidates to assess their motivation. The first results following the adoption of the Tengai robot have been regarded as successful and brought significant media attention to the municipality due to the innovative approach to recruitment.",

    "Description": "The Swiss State Secretariat for Migration is testing a new, data-driven method for assigning asylum seekers to cantons across the country. Asylum seekers in the pilot program will be assessed by an algorithm designed to maximize their chances of finding a job. The algorithm will allow officials to send individuals to the canton that best fits their profile, rather than allocate them randomly, as under the current system. The program will then follow these asylum seekers over several years, comparing their employment rates to those of others who entered the country at the same time. The pilot is including two thousand people, half placed in cantons with the guidance of the algorithm and half placed randomly. \nThe algorithm’s recommendations take into account constraints such as the limited space in a canton, and placement officials make the final decision in each case. The placement algorithm was developed by the Immigration Policy Lab (IPL), which has branches at Stanford University and ETH Zurich, and an affiliated researcher from Dartmouth College",

    "Website": "",
    "Description": "A predictive system called the \"Early Help Profiling System (EHPS)\" used in Hackney County (London), which uses data from a variety of different sources to identify children and families considered vulnerable and at risk of child abuse to the municipality. The data includes statistics from different government agencies, such as school attendance, housing information, economic indicators, and others. This allows early intervention to these families, avoiding the occurrence of a crisis with more expensive follow-up actions.  Each month, the social workers team gets a list of 20 families who are of high risk and unknown to the social workers at that time. Social workers then decide based on the information to conduct an early intervention, such as support from a child centre or a health assessment. It has been reported that the model had a high accuracy, with more than 80% of the risk alerts deemed valid, despite challenges with continuous updating of some data sources. The system was expected to help councils save around one million euro per year by having early, targeted interventions. However, the system was heavily criticized. The nature of the data collection and the risk assessment was very opaque as data is processed by a private company, leading to concerns by citizens. Those whose data was used were not informed and it was kept a secret which indicators were to determine the risks, since a private company was responsible for the development and argued that the information was commercially sensitive. Others noticed that the system was only put in place to cope with the austerity measures put in place, as the system was advertised to maximize payments from the Troubled Families programme. \nNow Hackney Council stopped working with the programme as it did not realise the expected benefits.",

The bureaucratic burden is increased by the fact that documents are requested at different places in a redundant manner and that there is usually (still) no electronic data exchange. Immediately after the birth, this creates additional work for many parents - in addition to the often tense domestic situation.\n\nThe guiding principle of the project is: \"The data runs, not the parents\". First, in 2018, a citizen-friendly, only three-page combination form was developed for entering all necessary data once. Thanks to a cross-institutional parents can hand it in directly at the maternity clinic, and the cooperation partners take care of everything else. take care of everything else. Parents now receive their child's birth certificate by post much faster. The parents now receive their child's birth certificate, the tax ID, the entry in the registration system and the child benefit notice much more quickly by post.

On this basis, an online service was service was developed in 2019, which will initially be offered as a pilot to a limited target group in June 2020. at the Asklepios Clinic in Altona.

In the case of suspected recourse, a standardised document was forwarded to the central office for recourse proceedings and manually pre-checked.  Based on about one million completed (successful and unsuccessful) recourse and unsuccessful) subrogation proceedings, an AI is trained to assess to what extent there is a sufficient probability of successful subrogation proceedings in current and old cases. exists in current and old cases. Using text mining, the data is also searched for critical keywords to provide further to provide further supporting information for the later decision by the case handler. (Were the police called? Was there an assault?). The forecasts and all information necessary for the decision are made available to the recourse department via a web interface. The AI calculates the plausibility for a possible recourse procedure, the amount of the total costs and at the same time forecasts the probability of success.",

At the same time reliable manual translation of many different languages with in-house expertise is not available.\n Machine translations have been created using a neural network trained with translated texts. Foreign-language documents can thus be can be searched in a more targeted way, e.g. to get a quick overview. One goal of the further expansion of the project is to develop a translation memory: \nThis means that everything that has already been processed as input or output is recognised. In regular operation this is to be shifted to a central translation platform. Time critical translations in particular time-critical translations in particular. In addition, the system should lower the threshold for work translations, which can be produced within seconds, and allow initial access to foreign-language documents.",

    "Description": "The Portuguese national health service is tax-funded, and otherwise mostly free of charge for the citizens. \nRegarding telephone triage, Portugal has a national free of charge helpline for emergencies (112) and a separate national health service contact center helpline for non-emergent situations (SNS24), at the cost of a local call. Originally established in 1999, SNS24 evolved into a multichannel contact centre with the mission to facilitate the citizen’s access to the public healthcare services. Whilst providing several different services to callers, its core service is the nurse-led triage that uses protocols developed by the governmental public health agency. \nThe Triage, Counselling and Referral Service (TAE) is a telephone service provided by the Contact Centre of the National Health Service - SNS 24.\n\nIn 2018, more than 1 million calls with an average duration of 7-8 minutes were answered. Being of national scope, this is a service that promotes equity in the access to health care.\nTelephone service is provided by nurses and follows pre-defined clinical algorithms. Triage is based on a specific clinical algorithm (out of a set of 59), and the choice of the most appropriate algorithm is extremely important and relevant. \nThe selected clinical algorithm should ensure high safety (not failing to identify situations that require urgent medical contact) and should have high discriminatory capability.\n\nIn this context, the SNS24 Scout.AI will apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, aiming the development of decision support tools with two main objectives:\n1. Support the nurse in the selection of the most appropriate clinical algorithm.\n2. Provide support to Directorate-General of Health (DGS) in the optimization process of the design of clinical algorithms and their referrals.\n\nThe first objective will be achieved by identifying the most appropriate algorithms for a given set of symptoms, with adjustment for age and sex. The AI methodology to be applied will be based on a classifier built on automatic learning algorithms on an anonymised data set, obtained from contacts of the SNS 24 in 2017 and 2018. This data represents accumulated experience in around 2 million cases.\nAfter the creation of the prediction model, it will be implemented in the SNS 24 TAE Service as decision support, indicating in real time which algorithms are most likely to be used. \n\nThe second goal is to create a support tool in the process of optimising the design of clinical algorithms and their referrals.\nAdding to the data already mentioned the referral and its adequacy, as well as the diagnoses established at hospital level, it will be possible to:\n- assess the clinical performance of each referral, when classified in terms of safety and discriminatory capacity;\n- predict the impact of potential changes to algorithms in terms of safety and performance;\n- predict hospital-level diagnoses for each algorithm or set of symptoms.\n\nWith this analysis, it will also be possible to detect any anomalous patterns and allow the DGS to make more informed decisions supported by real world data.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques developed specifically for the Portuguese language will be used, as well as Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). The motto of the texts, the extraction of appointed entities and the creation of lists of bigrams and trigrams, as well as the association with international medical classification systems (International Classification of Diseases), using ontology mapping techniques will be carried out. At ML level, automatic classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and deep\nneural networks (e.g. bi-LSTM with attention mechanisms) will be developed. Statistical methodologies will also be applied to detect anomalous situations in the application of clinical algorithms and their referral. Therefore, the SNS24 Scout.AI project will automatically analyse the information recorded within the SNS 24 TAE Service, using a built-in classifier using ML techniques to help nurses select the most appropriate clinical algorithm. It will also support the optimisation of the design in the SNS 24 algorithms by analysing the results of the referral of each case, improving its discriminatory capacity and clinical safety.",

The province of South Holland wants its roads and waterways to be safe and accessible, to which end it has introduced the Smart Shipping programme. In a partnership with the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, this programme stimulates smarter, safer, and more efficient use of waterways, so they can stay competitive with other modes of transport. To make smart mobility possible, 55 of the provincial bridges have been equipped with sensors to see whether the bridge is open or not. Induction loops are installed in roads, that measure the amount of traffic. The app uses this data to make sure that ships don’t have to wait unnecessarily long for bridges to open, while minimizing impact on road mobility.",

Using AI, the province can gain insights as to the current state of vegetation on the Dutch Waddeneilanden (Frisian Islands). Up until this project was started, this vegetation registration was done once very 6 or 12 years by inspectors who would go to the islands. However, this process was both too labor intensive and at large intervals. So now AI interprets satellite images, and hard-to-judge areas are reviewed manually by inspectors. An additional benefit is that many of the vegetation is very sensitive to nitrogen. This means that keeping an accurate eye on the island vegetation also helps draw up accurate nitrogen models.",

    "Description": "This project aims to solve the problem that many individuals want to live more environmentally sustainable lives, but are not financially able to do so. The target of this subsidy are people who live in houses with a property value of no more than 200 000 euros. These people qualify for subsidies that can help them make their house more sustainable, ranging from 300 to 3000 euros. Allotment normally takes a lot of effort and time, because forms need to be scanned and judged. This process would take up to 6 weeks and cost a lot of manpower, which was often more costly than the subsidy in question. This project aims to optimize the existing process: it is an automation project. We started with a cluster data analysis to target the correct people for this subsidy. When these people apply for a subsidy, their application is examined by an algorithm. If the applications meets the qualifications, the subsidy is automatically awarded. The process is thus reduced from several weeks to a few days. This benefits the applicants, as the subsidy is only awarded after they have implemented the steps to make their house more sustainable. If the algorithm cannot award a subsidy, a human will be involved. This means that subsidies are never automatically rejected. In addition to innovative technical aspects, this case process was also innovative. We worked according to the “garage methodology”, using funnels, scrum, and product owners. It cost time to implement this approach, but it works very well for implementing new technology.",

SZW has supplied various risk patterns, which are traced in banking data with scripts. These connections are then checked by persons. If approved, this can be a motive for a further investigation by the Financial Intelligence Unit into suspicious transactions. Based on that investigation, the public prosecutor can decide to write a warrant, which the judge can use as cause for a further investigation. If so, address and transaction details will be supplied by the bank. These are used to trace potential victims – not perpetrators – of human trafficking. This pilot uses linear scripts which are then vetted for false positives by a human controller. The possibility of using machine learning to hone this process with machine learning in the future is under investigation, as well as possible expansion to 4 other large banks.",

This project is the product of a collaboration between IBM and the Rotterdam Municipality. It is a pilot project in IJsselmonde and Delfshaven in the first two quarters of 2021. The idea, based on the results, is to expand to large and middel-sized Dutch municipalities. In doing so, IBM wants to always collaborate with local municipal debt relief organizations. Nationally, the project is executed in collaboration with several debt relief organizations. IBM sees this project as a way to make a social contribution with their own knowledge and technology, and has no profit motive in this project. IBM maintains cost price rates and makes its own investments in this project, in addition to financing from subsidies from funds and municipalities.",

In addition, the method can also help explain laws and investigate whether they are executable. An organization must be able to explain that it is legitimately carrying out laws – also when it uses AI to do so. Calculemus Flint ensures that normative law texts are understandable for all parties, which can improve the acceptance of and normative basis for artificially taken decisions.

    "Description": "The city of Amsterdam has taken various measures to combat the further spread of COVID-19 and to spread awareness on the importance of keeping 1.5 meters distance from one another. To that end, the city has implemented the 1.5 meter monitor. A camera takes a picture of a public scene, and the system automatically calculates the distance between people. Passers-by can see this picture, on which faces have been replaced with smileys, on a screen. This tells them whether they are keeping their distance: a green smiley for more than 1.8 meters distance, an orange smiley for 1.5 to 1.8 meters distance, and a red smiley for less than 1.5 meters distance. Pedestrians are also warned with audio signals. The system does not save the photographs it takes, so images are used only for a direct warning to pedestrians. However, the total amount of pedestrians within range of the camera is recorded, so that it is possible to monitor whether a certain area is too busy. The 1.5 meter monitor is temporarily employed because of emergency ordinance COVID-19 and the necessity of keeping 1.5 meters distance. The system is being test in a number of public spaces in the Amsterdam—Amstelland region.",

    "Description": "Support system for the classification of incidences/complains from citizens in Barcelona. \nIRIS is the service that allows citizens to report incidents or send complaints to the Barcelona City Council for resolution. Through IRIS, citizens can send information and queries, as well as complaints and suggestions for improvement. In this process, the citizen who reports the incident has to classify it using a tree of topics offered through the computer application. This classification is important because it is used to direct the incident directly to the responsible department, thus speeding up the response process. Errors in the thematic classification cause inadequate responses and delays in the resolution of incidents, thus affecting the quality of the service offered.\nAs part of the IRIS service update project, a module called MARIO has been developed, based on machine learning algorithms -Machine Learning- and natural language processing (one of the technologies included in the IA) to simplify the incident classification process for citizens. From the analysis of the free text describing the incident, MARIO suggests to the citizen the most likely categories where the incident fits because he/she chooses the most appropriate category.\nMARIO, which is currently being tested, minimizes the error rate in the initial classification of incidents by greatly reducing manual reclassification processes. Previously, 50% of the communications made needed to be reassigned; now, with MARIO, a hit rate of over 85% is being achieved.\nMARIO has been developed using open source tools -Open Source- such as Python, Scikit-*learn and *Pandas, among others. The algorithm has required a training that has been carried out using a dataset with the topics and questions asked by the citizen previously validated to ensure that they have been correctly classified.\nThis pilot has been used by the Municipal Institute of Informatics to evaluate the techniques and processes of text classification with the following conclusions:\nOften the integration of AI techniques into existing processes has to be accompanied by a restructuring of the data. In the case of IRIS, the wide range of classification options makes the task difficult for a human but makes *IA inefficient. Clustering of categories is recommended\n- It is important to have a quality dataset.\n- In order to ensure good system efficiency, good data preprocessing including cleaning and standardization of this data is necessary.\n- Data anonymization must be taken into account.\n- For good training, it is necessary to have a representative volume of input data that is homogeneous in all categories.",

    "Description": "The project plans to develop a set of tools to facilitate this process, including one that will optimize the coefficients of hourly distribution of photovoltaic generation based (or any other renewable resource) on the electricity consumption profiles of each user. This process is currently very difficult to carry out with the available tools, since it requires knowledge and forecasting of the consumption habits of the users. The new tool will be able to make such predictions, which together with the prediction of photovoltaic production (or any other renewable resource), will allow the calculation of optimized self-consumption scenarios. Thanks to this technology, users will also be able to adapt their consumption habits to promote self-consumption and, in the future, even offer service to the grid to promote its stability.\nThe tool is mainly composed of three modules: recruitment, planning and execution. Although AI will be used mainly in the third module, part of its results will also be used in phases one and two to help in system sizing and optimization, allowing the selection of the optimal number of PV panels. This will be done thanks to the automatic generation of statistical profiles according to the typologies of the users.",

The Stanford NER system was trained using 220 annotated pages and evaluated using 34 pages. The results that were achieved were mostly good: 71 % of person names and 79 % of place names were recognized from the evaluation data.\n2. Image classification\n-Google TensorFlow was used to classify images.\nA training dataset was created that was used to train the classifier model with TensorFlow. Using the trained model, it was possible to classify images into the following groups: advertisements, drawings, notes, pictures, paintings, maps or garbage.\n-The trained model was used to classify 50 000 images and its accuracy was about 70-75% when about 10 000 classified images were manually observed.\n-A graphical user interface was created that enabled an easier way to observe achieved results.",

The system has made it possible to reach a situation where the majority of the collection now floats, i.e. moves freely between libraries. IMMS gives public libraries control of collection, space, and float management. IMMS complements your existing ILS and creates an unprecedented level of transparency in your material flow.

In finding, allocating and proactively steering services, the model will make use of the decentralised and open network created by artificial intelligence and smart applications. The model will lead changes in the authorities’ operational model and will support these changes by implementing an ethically functioning artificial intelligence network, which will help to allocate the services correctly. In addition to implementing this AI network, the human-centric operations model will be adopted in the case of selected life events, run by the organisations in charge and supported by the AuroraAI support team.\n\nUsing artificial intelligence, the AuroraAI network will make it possible to allocate the current, partly silo-like supply of services in a timely manner to citizens or companies in need of such services. The information gained about those utilising the service will make knowledge-based management a more effective aid for the production of the services.",

By intervening before exacerbation occurs, it is possible to reduce the number of admissions and prevent deterioration. Based on patient reported measurements of blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate, the algorithm identifies whether there is a risk of exacerbation or heart failure, even before the event occurs. A deterioration in the patient’s condition warns the healthcare professionals and early preventive treatment can be initiated.",

The first one is to see if emails can be analysed to extract persons, functions, phones. Especially structured information are possible. Functions are difficult as it depends on the context.  Another Proof of Concepts is to extract information from forms. First, these letters have to be scanned before they can be analysed. However, the pilots showed that AI for everything is not always possible and 100% accuracy is not possible which requires validation by people. AI cannot understand text because they only correlate patterns. It may therefore be more useful for mailroom automation software.",

    "Description": "With the implementation of Building Information Management (BIM) , which (generally) relates to virtual construction and digital collaboration between all project partners within a construction project, the Roads and Traffic Agency (AWV) of the Flemish government is fully focused on the evolution towards a data-driven organization. AWV thereby exploits to the maximum the possibilities of modern digital methods and technologies to collect, manage and use correct, complete and up-to-date information about its assets. The 'assets' are the road infrastructure objects that AWV manages, maintains and operates: roads, cycle paths, tunnels, bridges and all peripheral infrastructure. With BIM, AWV can efficiently collect and manage all available information about its assets during their entire lifecycle (study and design phase / construction and installation / management and maintenance / replacement or disposal) in a central database. By collecting the asset data once and exchanging it in a standardized way. In the (further) development of the OTL information model, correctly typing the objects and adding properties to each object type poses few practical problems. However, establishing relationships between object types is a lot more complex. As part of this PIO project, AWV is looking for a widely applicable relationship tool for creating and managing semantic relationships between assets, in accordance with the OTL. In this way, better and more complex analyzes can be performed on the asset data in the 'virtual' copy, which should allow AWV to manage its assets more efficiently, to exploit them more efficiently and (also) maintain them predictively.",

    "Description": "A remote interpreting service offers the deaf the opportunity to communicate with hearing people (and vice versa) remotely in Flemish Sign Language. In order to offer the deaf the possibility to use a remote interpreting service anytime and anywhere in the future, various technical (hardware and software) and organizational innovations of the current systems are required. \nSeveral comparable services currently work side by side in Flanders . This fragmentation is hugely confusing for users. Scaling up through harmonization can reduce the organizational costs of a remote interpreting service and increase the use of the remote interpreting service.\nThe aim is that the deaf users can reach everyone by telephone (eg emergency services…) and that they can be called by everyone (eg colleagues, doctor…) in a language and communication mode of their choice and with protection of their own privacy.",

The city of Antwerp is confronted daily with one of the heaviest traffic congestions in Europe. To remedy this, the city's main mobility axes are being thoroughly reorganized. The accompanying works (also known as 'the yard of the century') put even greater pressure on mobility and quality of life in and around the city. A disruptive approach is therefore imperative to face these challenges. ALTRUIS must translate the street footage, which in itself has little value, through its interpretation to mobility context and insights that can lead to smart mobility solutions in the city of Antwerp (primarily the Smart Zone).",

Currently, the control is based on spot checks in the field. High-resolution images from various satellites are able to quickly map the correct information. This allows for better follow-up, guidance and control of the farmers. Also possibly. crop damage due to drought or flooding can be objectified more quickly. The project was entitled CAPSAT: CAP stands for 'Common Agricultural Policy' and SAT for 'satellite'.",

Via such a profile, the city of Antwerp wants to offer personalized recommendations to Antwerp culture lovers (tailor-made culture) at their own request and on the basis of their digital cultural DNA .The intended technological solution for SOCRATES is a Digital Experience Platform (DXP) that, as mentioned, is nourished by a personal culture profile and enriched with a wonder algorithm . The aim is to build the DXP in a modular way so that a maximum link with existing and future IT architecture, in particular the Antwerp City Platform as a Service (ACPaaS), is possible. ACPaaS offers a 'block box' of reusable (generic) backend services via engines so that (specific) frontend applications can be made faster, simpler and more powerful. The DXP intended with SOCRATES as an extension of ACPaaS extends this line to the application frontends, or all digital touchpoints with the (cultural) users.Based on the digital cultural profile of the user, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can make suggestions for, for example, literature and all kinds of cultural activities. The AI ​​algorithms are specifically trained to 'amaze' the user ( serendipity ) with sufficient diversity in the cultural offer so that the user does not get stuck in his own protected information bubble (or filter bubble ).",

    "Description": "Regulations are extremely valuable information that is relevant to everyone in our society. However, the large amount of divergent and incoherent regulation leads to information silos. There are so many different types of documents that there is little structure to be found in them. Moreover, the regulations on a particular subject are often spread over various (basic) laws, amendments to, additions to and improvements to those laws. That is impractical.  Lawyers are working to clarify this by harmonizing (coordinating) and bringing together (codifying) this fragmented legislation. But this does not yet solve the problem sufficiently. With the project 'Smart Regulations' we want to offer a solution by using Artificial Intelligence to train computers to interpret regulations. For example, computers can very accurately extract the correct information from those regulations for specific target groups (this can be people, applications or machines).  \nThe goal is therefore to be able to offer an 'engine' on unstructured information sources from legislation, regulations and decision-making that users can subscribe to in order to get data and additional insights from these information sources more quickly according to their needs. This is how regulation becomes smart. There are even new insights emerging.",

    "Description": "On Flemish motorways, road lighting is only on where it is needed. Specifically, the light goes out when possible and stays on when necessary.\nIn 2011, the Agency for Roads and Traffic (AWV) developed a light vision in response to the European Union's climate target to reduce energy consumption by 20% by 2020. Since then, the number of illuminated road sections has fallen by almost half. Currently, the road lighting is controlled on the basis of historical traffic intensities and weather forecasts per province. However, local and real time data on traffic intensity and weather conditions are available. Through a combination of rule-based algorithms and machine learning, internal and external data sources can be integrated into the current system that controls the road lighting. AWV wishes to use this data to make a more accurate and location-based decision whether or not road lighting should be on on a specific road segment. In this way, AWV can make a more efficient contribution to climate objectives and to promoting road safety. Moreover, the system will also allow to significantly reduce the workload of the operators.",

The AWV winter service is supported for this with various data sources and technical tools. AWV has been investing for some time in its own ice cream measurement system (GMS) that combines real-time results from measuring points and measuring stations with weather forecasts from the RMI.The knowledge and expertise of the employees is very different and is translated into a not very consistent spreading policy across the districts. However, the roads do not stop at the boundary line between two districts. That is why AWV wants to have a system developed that can support district employees in their choice of spreading and that can lead to more uniform spreading decisions across the districts. By combining physical rules and machine learning techniques , the system can help make the assessment and indicate which type of spreading material, in what quantity and at what time, is most appropriate to make and keep the roads in the district ice-free.",

    "Website": "https://www.innovatieveoverheidsopdrachten.be/en/projects/removal-dumped-war-ammunition-north-sea",
    "Description": "On the sandbank De Paardenmarkt , located in the North Sea about 1.5 kilometers from the coast of Knokke, there are an estimated 35,000 tons of dumped ammunition (mainly) from WWI. It concerns both conventional and chemical ammunition. To date, there is no danger to the marine environment or public health, but there is an ongoing risk of the (chemical) munitions rusting through or tearing through (due to ship strikes), resulting in heavy (chemical) pollution. Moreover, the ammunition dump at De Paardenmarkt may in the future be an obstacle to coastal safety in general and to further developments around the port of Zeebrugge in particular. The Maritime Access department of the Department of Mobility and Public Works (MOW) of the Flemish government therefore wants to have a test carried out in the context of this PIO project that should demonstrate how this ammunition dump could be done safely and in a time and cost-effective way be cleaned up. The following topics are covered: precision detection of the position of the ammunition, continuous monitoring of the environment, removal of the overlying sediments, deepening of the ammunition and safe transport to the mainland with robot technology. The aim of the test is to locate a piece (or unit ) of ammunition a few meters below the seabed as precisely as possible within the larger ammunition dump and, regardless of the type or condition of the piece, to dig it up and bring it ashore (further disposal / processing of the collected ammunition is not part of the test). For this, the necessary survey systems and robot technology will have to be developed and / or tested that make it possible to reduce the risks to humans and the marine environment to a minimum. If successful, the tested solutions can be purchased and deployed for a full-scale clean-up operation.",

As part of the pilot, the Feelingstream application transcribed the Social Insurance Board's calls from May to August 2020 (3 months) in Estonian and Russian. The Feelingstream application provides an opportunity to get both a statistical overview and a detailed understanding of customers' concerns across several customer communication channels - calls, emails and chatbot. Customer contact analysis is the fastest and most immediate way to find places in services that the customer is in trouble with and that can be changed quickly. The analysis creates insights for managerial decision-making, which in turn leads to better and more efficient public services. The pilot project involved an information line manager and two service managers. In the pilot project, SKA chose Feelingstream as a partner, which specializes in analyzing customer contacts in Estonian and Russian. The analysis creates insights for managerial decision-making, which in turn leads to better public services to make them faster and more convenient for citizens to use.",

The tool helps the user of the e-Land Register to understand detailed data, such as easements and mortgages. It is a tool based on neural networks. Machine translation creates links from a large database, which improves itself over time, refining vocabulary and thus improving translation quality.

Instead, in the future, a bureaucrat will allow a person from any device and through a virtual assistant to get everything they need done in one communication session.\nThe bureaucrat is thus an interoperable network of public sector kratts attached to national information systems, as well as those provided by the private sector, which, from the user's point of view, acts as a single channel for obtaining public direct and information services.",

During the pilot, the PBGB took on two focuses: directing customers to use more e-channels and improving the display and content of customer information.  \n The pilot project focused on calls concerning the issuance of documents. This was already known to be the biggest reason customers call. The self-service for applying for identity cards and travel documents created by the PBGB has led a quarter of applications to the e-channel. The analysis carried out indicated that since the request for documents takes place every 5-10 years, a long enough time has passed since the previous procedure that next time the clients will no longer remember the right steps to do. The analysis identified those bottlenecks that prevent customers from getting in trouble and further digitizing the document issuance service.",

Remote sensing data are mainly used as source data, but forest notifications, soil maps and other data (incl. Teaching and validation data) are also input. As a result of the processing, all-Estonian map layers are completed for the most important assessment features, such as a raster map of tree vegetation tree species (for identification by main tree species).",

COMPRISE H2020 project is experimenting a solution for this. Tilde – a leading European language technology company – in collaboration with the Estonian national Centre of Registers and Information Systems (RIK) has developed a solution for automated transcription of court hearings in all 9 national and regional courts of the country. The solution has brought significant improvements to the efficiency and speed of producing court session recordings and protocolling. Speech recognition models have been adapted for the rather rich domain content – more than 800 hours of transcribed audio files have been used for the development of the acoustic models and over 800 million words worth of textual data have been used for the custom language model development. As a result, the solution which provides for real-time, as well as offline speech recognition has high quality of speech recognition, where word error rates (WER) vary between 8 and 15%, and this is a very good result given the actual conditions at court hearings. This solution is built to run on the RIK’s infrastructure thus safeguarding the security and availability to authorized users only.",

    "Description": "This study focuses on the statistical characterization of ice conditions (extent, sea ice occurrence probability (SIOP), and length of ice season) in the Gulf of Riga, Baltic Sea, using remote-sensing data. The optical remote-sensing data with 250 m resolution acquired by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002–2011 were used for statistical characterization of sea ice. A method based on bimodal histogram analysis of remote-sensing reflectance data was developed to discriminate ice from water. In general, ice extent information obtained from MODIS data agrees with the official ice chart data (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and in situ measurements) and multi-sensor product containing data from microwave and infrared instruments (R² >0.83). However, in case of severe winters and extremely mild winters there are differences in the dates when maximum ice extent is registered. MODIS data can be used for detailed analysis of ice extent in specific basins of Baltic Sea. Depending on the year, the ice season length in the Gulf of Riga ranged from 68 to 146 days, and the maximum ice extent varied greatly from 329 to 15,350 km². SIOP and number of ice days increased significantly in areas where the depth is less than 15 m. Based on negative-degree days and ice cover characteristics (SIOP and ice season length), three winter scenarios were defined: severe (2003, 2006, 2010, and 2011), medium (2004 and 2005), and mild (2007, 2008, and 2009).",

    "Description": "The National Heritage Board, together with pilot museums, will test the Artificial Intelligence of conservation and inventory Kratt Säll, which will make museum inventories more convenient and faster. Today, it takes an average of 19 minutes for two people to make an inventory of one museum in the Museum Information System. For example, in a future shared repository or larger museums, inventorying a 2.5 million object will take 47.5 million minutes, or 90.3 years. This time is also the reason why it is often not possible to ensure the long-term preservation of all museum objects. One of the most important goals is to find a smart solution for controlling the condition and location of museums, based on the physical characteristics of each museum (eg material, age, condition) and the storage environment of the museum to determine the need and interval for inspections. If successful, this would allow time-consuming inventories to be abandoned in the future and replaced by needs-based controls. With the help of Kratt Säll, we want to take inventories and condition surveys of museums to a new level. The use of krat changes the traditional and very time-consuming work step, giving the custodian the information they need to make decisions quickly. It predicts the aging processes of the museum and indicates objects that would need immediate preservation or rapid intervention.",

The preliminary application for the project was declared compliant by the State Information System Board. The National Heritage Board will start preparing the procurement in order to start the analysis and prototyping of the search in case of a positive decision. The project analyzes how museums can be described as kratt and creates a prototype called Folli, who is like a real museum worker, because Folli recognizes what is depicted in the picture and makes this information available to us. The prototype will be developed and tested in collaboration with pilot museums and volunteers. More than 10 Estonian museums have given up as pilot museums, and other memory institutions have also shown interest. The aim of the project is to take an important step towards automating the description of a museum. Image recognition has been practiced in both memory institutions and the private sector, but it is more about experiments or looking for solutions to individual questions (eg whether there is a man or a woman in the image). The analysis to be created must find answers to the questions of how to develop a chatbot that recognizes objects, activities and themes in images. However, the prototype can already find answers to some questions that need to be solved.",

As part of the pilot, the Feelingstream application Unemployment Insurance Fund transcribed calls from April to August 2019 (5 months).  The main reason for calling with the chosen type of support was related to the receipt of grants. From a human point of view, it is very clear why issues related to the receipt of money arise and the volume of calls is therefore significantly higher at the beginning of the month. Following the pilot project, work was carried out to improve e-environments and there were other findings that continued to work to improve the customer experience.",

    "Description": "There must be a more efficient way of doing this, thought the data scientists at the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI), and so they developed the Forensic Image Recognition Engine (FIRE) software library. Working on the basis of existing models, the experts created a machine learning algorithm that, after ‘training’, is able to find the proverbial needle in the haystack. Using artificial intelligence is not just interesting in drugs cases involving shipping containers but can also be valuable for many other police investigations. Above all, automating the search process saves massive amounts of time and frees up police officers for other tasks.",

By using expert insight gained from extensive interviews with the Dutch and Belgian police, it was possible to establish how to best process NCMEC referrals. The AviaTor Project is funded by the European Union's Internal Security Fund – Police.  ZiuZ develops a solution AviaTor, which stands for Augmented Visual Intelligence and Targeted Online Research, is an efficient tool that helps you prioritise all aspects of CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) reports, so that you can focus on identifying perpetrators and saving victims. By combining visual intelligence to help prioritize reports with online sources for additional information, AviaTor reduces the time spent by law enforcement agencies processing CSAM reports. This makes the processing not only quicker, but also more efficient and complete.",

    "Website": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8883382",
    "Description": "In response to the desire to improve road safety and vehicle traffic, the INZNAK project was proposed. This project aims to improve road traffic by developing and building a network of autonomous road signs. The use of intelligent road signs in road traffic will prevent the most common collisions on highways, resulting from speed not being adapted to weather conditions, the condition of the surface and damming? vehicles in the event of a need to brake suddenly. During the project, 3 types of signs will be developed: standing, hanging and mobile. Each sign will have a display that will present hints for drivers along with a suggested speed. Hints will be displayed in the form of text and image messages, which will warn or inform about current traffic disruptions. Thanks to the use of a string of signs placed along the road, drivers will be warned much faster about possible dangers on the road. This is due to the fact that each of the signs will communicate with the others, making it easier to manage traffic. The signs will communicate in LoraWan and LTE technology. LoraWan technology will enable the characters to communicate with each other. And LTE technology will be used to send and receive messages from the traffic control center. The use of two-level communication allows the solution to become independent from possible failures of the telecommunications infrastructure. To ensure the flow of up-to-date information to autonomous signs, it is necessary to equip them with a number of sensors, which will analyze the traffic in the vicinity of the sign on an ongoing basis. The experimental installations of intelligent signs will be equipped with sensors analyzing road traffic, such as: Doppler radar, lidar, acoustic probe, RGB camera, Bluetooth receiver. Due to the fact that changing weather conditions, such as: storms, blizzards, fog, black ice, are also a big risk on the road. A weather station will be installed in each sign, analyzing the current weather conditions around the sign. As a result, the resolution of weather measurements will be very high. The proposed approach to traffic analysis is based on the principles of multimodality, thanks to which it is possible to supplement each of the individual methods with a different one in a place where it better serves its purpose. Such a case can be observed e.g. at night, where standard vision cameras mainly capture car lights. The use of a lidar device in such conditions allows for proper detection of most vehicles. In the next chapter, individual modalities used in the conducted research will be presented.",

One of the essential elements of the system is the introduction of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning mechanisms. Algorithms will be developed to analyze the relationship between the intensity of historical and on-line precipitation and the change in the water level (flood wave) on the river or the occurrence of the so-called flash flood.",

Currently, each lamp is individually controlled and monitored. This allows you to achieve significant savings and set different times for switching the lighting on and off. In addition, lamps near pedestrian crossings turn on earlier and then turn off in relation to the others, which increases the lighting and thus safety at pedestrian crossings. Full preview and the ability to monitor lighting parameters also allows to reduce the response time to failures. This, in turn, ensures minimal interruptions in lighting operation. The possibility of monitoring the parameters of the luminaires also enables earlier planning of maintenance works and minimizing their costs.",

    "Website": "",
    "Description": "In November 2017, the office of the Secretary of State for Energy released some software, known as BOSCO, to companies providing electricity. The aim of BOSCO was to determine whether people were entitled to financial aid to help; them with their electricity bills. The reasoning behind the ADM was twofold. Firstly, that it would make the process much easier for aid applicants (although, this didn’t seem to be the case judging by the large number of complaints the system received) and secondly, that it would also make the process easier and more efficient for the public utility companies.After receiving many reports that the software was not functioning properly, Civio, a Madrid-based non-profit investigative newsroom and citizen lobby, discovered that BOSCO was systematically denying aid to eligible applicants. Civio asked the government for the BOSCO source code to identify why those errors were happening. The request passed through three different ministries before ending up at the Committee for Transparency and Good Governance, which refused to share the code saying that it would violate copyright regulations (even though the software had been developed by the public administration itself).In July 2019, Civio filed an administrative complaint arguing that the source code of any ADM system used by the public administration should be made public by default, in the same way that legal texts are made public. The case – which at the time of writing was ongoing – could end up at the Spanish Supreme Court, and could set a legal precedent.",

    "Description": "In 2016, the local police of Rivas-Vaciamadrid, a town of 86,000 people in the Madrid region, ran a pilot of the Pred-Crime software, developed by Spanish company EuroCop (Europa Press, 2015). Pred-Crime analyzes historical data to predict where and when it’s more likely that different types of common misdemeanors and offenses, like traffic violations and robberies, will be committed. Reportedly, the plan was to fully implement this software during 2016, but after testing it for nine months the municipality decided not to go on using it. EuroCop says on its website that it has dozens of municipalities from all over Spain among its customers, but it doesn’t specify whether those local authorities are using its predictive software or any of the other non-predictive tools the company also markets. In another case of predictive policing, the Spanish police have reportedly been using software that analyzes the available data about the victim of a killing and the context of the crime, and then produces the likely profile of the killer. Between 2018 and 2019, agents of the office of the Secretary of State for Security have collaborated with the police by using such software in at least five investigations, according to a press report (Pérez Colomé, 2019b)",

    "Description": "In January 2018, the regional Government of Catalonia started a pilot project to try and measure the impact among the public of its STEMcat’s initiatives, a plan aimed at promoting scientific and technological vocations among young people.\n\nFor a month and a half, the Catalan government used Citibeats. This text-analysis software used machine-learning algorithms to collect and analyze around 12,000 tweets that spoke about the STEM disciplines in Catalonia. One of the insights the authorities said that they had gained was that women were more responsive to messages about natural sciences than about technology, according to the Catalan government’s PR. The authorities then used that and other insights to “optimize their strategy and propose new initiatives” to make young people interested in the STEM disciplines. The project was part of SmartCAT, the Catalan government’s strategy to become a smart region (as noted in this chapter, regional governments in Spain have a high degree of autonomy to develop their policies). The SmartCAT director said the software had allowed them “to evaluate in a more objective way the impact of the (government’s) initiatives” to make people interested in science and technology.\n\nCitibeats, developed by Social Coin, a Barcelona-based start-up, was also used in December 2017 by the Barcelona municipality to gather people’s attitudes towards public transport and mobility in the city by analyzing around 30,000 comments by more than 15,000 people. In a case study of this project, Citibeats spoke of “citizens as sensors”.\n\nIn the two cases described above, and while the authorities praise the software’s ability to gather and analyze thousands of online comments (something it would take much more time and money to do using traditional survey methods), it’s not clear how representative those samples are and how valid the conclusions might be; and there doesn’t seem to be any information on how those analyses then influenced public policy.\n\nSince March 2019, the regional government of Navarra has also been using the Citibeats software to detect online hate speech by analyzing text published on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nAs with other cases dealing with personal data, it’s not clear how the software works and what oversight mechanisms the public authority may have in place when using it.",

    "Description": "As cities aim to start using big data and automated processes to become “smart”, a series of ADM systems have been embedded at the municipal level in Spain. These systems usually support decision-making rather than working entirely autonomously. One such example is the Smart Waste platform, which collects data from sensors installed in bins and trucks, and also from social media, surveys, the census, and satellite information. The combined data helps local authorities decide what services will be needed when and where. Smart Waste was developed by The Circular Lab (from the innovation center of Ecoembes) which is a non-profit organization charged with collecting plastic packaging, cans, cartons, paper, and cardboard packaging for recycling. Minsait, a division of Indra, a Spanish multinational transport, defense, and security technology consultancy company also helped develop the platform. During 2018, the Logroño municipality and the La Rioja and Cantabria regional governments first ran the platform as a pilot and today it is available to local and regional authorities all over Spain. As is the norm in almost every case in Spain, there does not seem to be any available information on how the software works, what kind of output it produces, and what decisions or changes the different authorities have adopted due to its use.",

    "Website": "",
    "Description": "Since 2019, the local police in the cities of Kortrijk, Kuurne, and Lendelde (VLAS) have been using a ‘smart’ video surveillance system developed by an American company called Briefcam. According to the police, the goals of the system are as follows:\nTo aid. For instance, if a person with a backpack and wearing a blue coat has fled in a certain direction, this person can be found easily by the algorithm. The person is then traced on other cameras to get a more complete picture of the route he or she took and to detect crimes that might have been committed. The system can also help search for lost children and solve bicycle theft more easily.\nThe generation of live. For instance, at the beginning and end of the school day, trucks are not permitted to drive near schools. If a truck is spotted driving through an area it is not allowed to, the system sends an alert to the police.\nCollect statistical information to support\nThe system stores all ‘objects’ (for example: people, small and large vehicles, and animals) that appear in the video images. An algorithm then decides what category each object belongs to, and, after this first categorization, a sub-categorization is made. For example, when it comes to people, the system categorizes each person as either a man, woman, or child before further categorizing by clothing: short/long sleeves, short/long trousers, color of clothing, and things such as hats, handbags, backpacks, etc. The same system of categorization is used for vehicles. For example, if the vehicle has two wheels: Is it a bicycle or a motorcycle? For different vehicles: Is it a car, pick-up, van, truck, or a bus? In addition, the direction, size, and velocity of the object are also registered. The system is also able to implement face recognition (PZVlas, 2019), although, at the moment, there is no legal framework to regulate use by the police. However, as the spokesperson of the VLAS police zone indicated in an interview: in exceptional circumstances, when requested by an investigatory judge, it is possible to use face recognition",

    "Name": "Algorithmic school registrations",
    "Website": "",
    "Description": "In many Belgian cities, there are problems when registering children for schools, especially when a lot of parents want to register their children at the same school. This has led to parents spending several nights in tents outside schools so that they can be the first to register their children. In response to this situation, which was considered unfair, several cities started organizing school registration via a central online system that uses an algorithm to decide in which school a child can be registered. In the system for primary schools, that is used in Leuven, a city east of Brussels, a number of variables are taken into account. On the basis of the answers given by the parents to a series of questions relating to the education level of the mother and whether or not the student receives a grant, students are then divided into ‘indicator students’ and ‘non-indicator students’. An indicator student is a student who is defined as having fewer life chances and is based upon the level of education of the mother and if the student is eligible for an education allowance. Further categorization happens on the basis of two criteria: distance from home to school and preference of school. The schools can decide how much weight they assign to distance and preference i.e. between 30%, 50%, or 70% for each (Meldjeaan, 2020). This weight can differ between cities, for instance, in Antwerp the schools have to assign a minimum of 50% to the distance criterium. For secondary schools, some cities also use an online registration system, which uses an algorithm to decide which school the child will go to. However, the system is not the same as for primary schools. As not every municipality has a secondary school, the distance criterium is considered discriminatory and, therefore, it is not taken up (Dierickx and Berlanger, 2019). The system does take into account priority students (i.e., children of the staff of the school) and indicator-students (see above). The algorithm works randomly on the basis of the first choice in three rounds (Aanmelden school, 2020). As the system does not take distance into account, this has led to situations where students from Brussels took up places in Flemish secondary schools outside of Brussels, and children, living close to the school not getting in and having to be registered in schools much farther away (Dierickx and Berlanger, 2019).",

    "Description": "For years, and with varying degrees of success, the Danish government has tried to centralize and automate tax administration. Attempts to centralize and automate tax collection in 2005 with EFI (Et Fælles Inddrivelsessystem or One Shared Tax collection system) failed, and EFI was shelved in 2015 (Alfter, 2019, 51). A new system, to collect billions of Danish crowns owed by taxpayers, was expected to be finalized by mid-2019, however, in September 2019, the Auditors of the Danish Parliament, Rigsrevision, published a critical report indicating that tax collection would only be fully up and running by the end of 2020, or later (Rigsrevisionen, 2019).\n\nMissing out on collecting billions of Danish crowns in tax revenue, however, is just one of several automatization concerns on the table of every new minister of finance. One heated discussion is about automatizing the estimation of property values – particularly in a context where housing costs are growing significantly in the capital and near larger cities while they are dropping elsewhere, thus affecting property owners in a country where large parts of the population own their own home. Passed in 2017, the Ejendomsvurderingslov (law on property assessment, 2017) states that automatic real estate valuation assessment will become standard practice. In preparation for the law, this fully automated system was described as “machine assessments” (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 36-37). The system is set to include “sales prices related to the neighborhood, location and size. Sales price levels are adjusted to take into account the distance to forests and recreation areas, schools, streets, railways”. The system will also take into account whether or not there is the possibility to build on the surrounding terrain and whether or not ground pollution is an issue (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). A total of 19 parameters will be used to automatically calculate property value (Version2 Editorial, 2019). A preparatory committee prepared an analysis to guide the government ahead of the legislation. The committee followed the overall line to move from “subjective to objective” assessments, from human to digital assessments, and from manual to automatic administration, to improve assessments and lower administration costs (Engbergudvalget, 2014, p. 68-69). While it does not explicitly mention it, this model uses a level of machine learning to develop a “statistical predictive model” (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). Furthermore, the overall assumption of the preparatory committee was that machine assessments were more objective than human assessments, where human assessments are considered subjective. As with many other systems, the automated property assessment system has been significantly delayed. Along the way, fears surfaced that it did not comply with Danish administrative law (Mølsted, 2018). It also proved to be more expensive than the estimate in the initial report regarding the cost of a property valuation calculated by a human (Motzfeldt, 2019-2). This project, and other problematic attempts by the Danish tax authorities to incorporate IT projects, have been described as “the ministers’ (…) IT-phantoms” (Version2 Editorial, 2019). The law to assess property values allows a variation of 40% in the value of a given property – 20% either side of the price calculated by the system – “and one does not need to hold a PhD in human behavior to predict that this will lead to protests if or when the system comes into use. Worst case we will see headlines that two newly built and identical houses will be taxed very differently. Could we blame citizens if they ask critical questions why they had to spend billions for a system with such a low level of precision” (Motzfeldt, 2019-2).",

    "Name": "Exam control in schools: fighting fraud or profiling students?",
    "Website": "",
    "Description": "You try to control me, I outsmart you. This was the logic of a Danish high school student who, in a post on Github, described how to disable a digital exam monitor (Schou, 2019). The move was part of massive protests by the students against The Digital Exam Monitor, developed by the Danish Ministry of Education (Den Digitale Prøvevagt), and which was set to roll out in spring 2019. Following the protests against this surveillance, which included copies of the clipboard, active websites in four browsers, a key logger, a screen dump every minute, or whenever an active window changed, detection of virtual machines in the background, a list of all active programs, various unique IDs, etc.) (Møller Kjemtrup, 2019), the ministry of education put the tool on hold (Undervisningsministeriet, 2019). Yet under the new social democrat government, students continue to ask the authorities to shelve it entirely (Mejlgaard, 2019). Meanwhile, another tool that uses machine learning to detect exam fraud has been developed at Copenhagen University. This move stirred new controversies and fears about student profiling in 2019. In 2014, high school software provider Macom supplied a tool called Lectio, which operated as an early detection system to trace students in danger of dropping out (Copenha- gen University, 2014). The tool was developed by university students and based upon information gathered through the administration and communication system used by 9 out of 10 Danish high schools, according to Macom and media reports. However, use of the algorithm was stopped about a week after it was introduced. The data used to develop it had been handed to a third party – the university and its master’s students – without permission from the high schools (Møllerhøj, 2015). More recently, in May 2019, a group at the same department of Copenhagen University published a machine learning system by the name of Ghostwriter. The developers said that it could be used to trace the writing style of students in assignments and that it could detect with some certainty, whether or not a student had submitted a text written by someone else. The aim of Ghostwriter was to fight exam fraud, but (the university wrote in a press release) that the model could also be applied elsewhere to detect texts written in an unusual style (Copenhagen University, 2019). The machine learning was based upon 130,000 student assignments held in the Lectio system by Macom. The ensuing controversy between the high schools, the university professor, and the director of Macom focused on a breach of contract related to the handling of the students’ data: “We feel unsafe when the data handling agreement is not respected,” a representative of the high schools stated to online technology news website Version2, (Bang Frederiksen, 2019-1; Bang Frederiksen, 2019-2; Bang Frederiksen, 2019-3).",

    "Description": "Since 2018, municipal governments in Estonia have been able to use a tool called The Youth Guarantee Support System (YGSS) (Mis on noortegarantii tugisüsteem? – Tööelu.ee o. J.). This tool helps case managers (social workers, child protection officers, youth workers, etc.) identify young people aged 16-26 who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). It is used to support them when they need to return to education or enter the labor market. Case managers of the Youth Guarantee Support System or the municipal government employees can see information about young people living in their specific locality. However, up until now, not all of the municipalities have joined the program. In order to join, the municipal governments have to send an application to the Municipal Government Information System for Social Services and Benefits (STAR). The case managers or municipal government employees are then shown a list in the STAR system of all the NEET youth who are registered as residents in a specific municipal area and who – according to other registry data – need help. This information is based on data from nine different registries, creating, therefore, a very comprehensive dataset that includes information on the young person’s address, email, phone number, educational background, and if they studied in Estonian or Russian. Young people have the right to forbid the analysis by a case manager, and in cases where the data is processed, young people must give their consent.  The case manager then contacts the young people identified by the system and a letter or an SMS is sent to each person asking them to complete a survey. The Youth Guarantee Support System Request is automatically triggered twice a year (15.03 and 15.10).",

Costa Rica is also involved in the project by allowing access to its medical billing database (to look at clinical/socio-economic data not included in EHIF databases). The pilot was officially launched in January 2017. Throughout the pilot, family practitioners joined a series of webinars, led by the local pilot coordinator (World Bank consultant), to reinforce and refresh the initial training. This solution contributes to the empowerment of primary care and also helps find the best algorithm to predict which patients with selected diagnoses are likely to be admitted to the hospital. The solution first identifies certain medical conditions/diagnoses in the EHIF’s medical invoice data- base. It then provides a practical model for family physicians to predict which patients are more likely to be admitted to the hospital or suffer other health problems.",

    "Website": "",
    "Description": "In October 2019, the Japanese multinational IT service provider, Fujitsu, announced that it was developing an AI solution for South Karelia’s social care and healthcare district (known by its Finnish acronym Eksote). The project employs machine learning methods with the aim of helping Eksote identify factors underlying social exclusion of young adults, as well as predicting associated risks. With the predictive model, social and healthcare professionals will be provided an overview of risk factors. According to Fujitsu’s press release, the model identifies some 90% of young adults susceptible to social exclusion. In practical terms, the model that is being used is derived from pseudonymized data taken from the use of Eksote’s services by young adults, and it uses this data to predict social exclusion outcomes defined by Eksote’s professionals. According to Eksote, the legislation on the secondary and combined use of healthcare data makes it possible to use only non-identifiable, pseudonymized data. This means that Fujitsu’s model cannot be used to identify individual young adults considered to be at risk of social exclusion; rather, the model produces a list of risk factors on a general level. The next step in the project is to examine whether it is possible, under the current legislation, to set up a consent-based system: a client’s consent would be asked for before using the predictive model on their individual data when they, for example, have an appointment with a social care or healthcare professional.",

    "Description": "In June 2018, Eksote announced that it had developed, in collaboration with the Finnish IT firm, Avaintec, an AI model to predict problems experienced by children and the youth. The aim was to identify problems early on, so that an intervention could be made and support provided to families sooner rather than later. Much like in the 2019 project on young adults and social exclusion, this model was based on explicitly defined undesired “endpoints”: low-grade averages, disciplinary interventions at school, high-class non-attendance figures, being taken into custody, acceptance into psychiatric care, and substance abuse. The model made use of data gathered from the IT systems of maternity clinics, kindergartens, schools, healthcare, and mental healthcare providers, as well as social services – e.g., it combined data from different administrative branches, namely social care, healthcare, and education. The outcome was the identification of a total of 1340 risk factors, ranging from bad teeth in children, to parents missing maternity clinic appointments, to the child’s siblings bullying others at school. These examples also give an idea of the kinds of data that were employed when making predictions. Ideally, the model would make it possible to continuously keep track of risk factors of individual children.",

The system was developed in cooperation with the Department of Forensic Psychology at the University of Konstanz. In order to assess a person already known to the authorities, the caseworker fills in a standardized questionnaire about the “observable behavior” of the subject, drawing on data the police previously gathered on the person and everything the police is legally authorized to access. Once the results of the corresponding threat levels are provided, the caseworker (or the respective department) decides what action to take.",

In the field of burglary prevention, the state of Hesse deploys the KLB-operativ forecast tool (Polizei Hessen, 2017), and Berlin uses KrimPro (Dinger, 2019). Both of these tools analyze data to identify where a potential break-in is most likely to occur.

The agency has the ability to obtain all the data contained on the devices and run software on it. The software presents the employee with a limited overview of the content, which also includes language analysis of the text retrieved. According to the BAMF, both the software and the hardware was provided by the firm Atos SE, however, VICE Magazine found evidence,   that the mobile forensic technology firm MSAB was also involved. Another tool deployed by the BAMF aims to identify disguised dialects in speech. When an asylum seeker does not have a valid proof of ID, a two-minute voice recording of the person describing a picture in their mother tongue is analyzed by software, which then calculates a percentage of how close the speech comes to a certain dialect.",

    "Description": "Since 2012, the Behörde für Arbeit, Soziales, Familie und Integration (Agency for Labor, Social Affairs, Family and Integration) in Hamburg has been using a piece of software called JUS-IT (Behörde für Arbeit Soziales Familie und Integration, 2018) for the General Social Service, the Child Care Service and the Economic Help for Youths Programme. It is used to administer cases and automate payments and is equipped with interfaces that connect it to police reports and health insurance funds. The system is based on Cúram – a modular off-the-shelf IBM product that can be tailored for specific needs – which has been criticized for functioning inaccurately in Canada (Human Rights Watch, 2018). In 2018, an expert commission on child protection (BÜRGERSCHAFT DER FREIEN UND HANSESTADT HAMBURG, 2018)found that JUS-IT lengthens administrative processes, leaving less time for much-needed family visits. As a result, the commission recommends major revisions or a complete shutdown (Lasarzik, 2019) of the software.",

The information available on the project’s web- site is very limited, even though the project has been up and running since August 2018. Nevertheless, it is evident from the website that the project aims to use tools such as face extraction and matching, to correlate information from social media data, and to continuously initiate complex associative searches across all sources relevant to criminal investigation. A successful freedom of information request revealed that trial runs will be organized, including in Greece, involving end-users and practitioners, such as law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders. The Hellenic Police (Border Unit) is involved in trials that run between January and August 2020, while reports of trial runs and tests are expected in the form of deliverables in April 2020 and January 2021. Two of the Greek stakeholders in SPIRIT’s consortium are the private companies Singular Logic and Nydor System Technologies. The project is due to end in July 2021.",

According to Cerqua, “many have already shown their interest” (Il Giorno 2019).\nRepresentatives from the consulting giant Deloitte also visited the Vimercate hospital specifically because of this project, wrote Giornale di Monza.“AI must not replace physicians”, says Head of Informatics at ASST Vimercate, Giovanni Delgrossi, “but support them, a tool that helps them making better decisions” (Sole 24 Ore 2019)",

    "Description": "In 2019, the first experiment with automated decision-making within the justice system was developed at LIDER Lab Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in collaboration with EMbeDS, KDD Lab and the Tribunal of Genoa (Gonews 2019).‎Predictive Justice is an ambitious long-term project built with an innovative approach and an underlying philosophy. The approach starts from the assumption that only the combination of different expertise and different tools in coherent and integrated pipelines can offer effective results in a short time. For this reason, the teams of each \"sub-project\" are interdisciplinary and the individual sub-projects also constitute autonomous projects from a scientific and operational point of view. Precisely the idea that the advancement of knowledge with its applicative implications offers pieces to be organized modularly in multiple ways has convinced us to organize the work in building-blocks projects. The ambitions are multiple and transversal: from the attempt to \"export\" knowledge, techniques, and solutions across disciplines (for example from omics to legal data mining) to the combination of protocols and software to automate the pseudonymization of texts or to the creation of innovative tools for querying legal materials through their automatic annotation to the construction of prediction tools based on data science and Intelligence Artificial, to the attempt to offer understandable explanations on the functioning of the tools produced / used adapting them to the needs / capabilities of the different end users. ‎ ‎All these steps are obviously articulated in full coherence with the corresponding regulatory and ethical framework, convinced that the regulatory and ethical profiles in research are central and go beyond mere adherence to the rules. ‎",

Anomalies recognized by the “digital eyes” of the system will alert fiscal authorities, who can then summon flagged individuals for further scrutiny. This algorithmic-driven monitoring has to be coupled with that of “open sources”, such as “news articles, websites and social media”, by the Italian fiscal authority, Agenzia delle Entrate. The monitoring system has been active since 2016, but was largely unknown to the public until January 2020. It was devised to “acquire all elements that could be useful in knowing the taxpayer”, thereby helping the institution check the consistency of each individual’s fiscal behavior (Corriere della Sera 2019b).",

    "Description": "XLAW software  also developed by a law enforcement official and it has already been deployed in the cities of Naples, Modena, Prato, Salerno, Livorno, Trieste, Trento, and Venice (Business Insider 2019), where it led to the arrest of a 55-year-old man accused of theft. Law information website Altalex reports that the system’s accuracy is 87-93% in Naples, 92-93% in Venice, and 94% in Prato, but, at the moment, no independent auditing or fact-checking is publicly available for each of these trials. \nXLAW is software that uses probabilistic, machine learning-powered solution for trends and pattern discovery in crimes. This implies that one can deduce — or more accurately, induce — how criminal behavior will unfold, before it has happened, by intelligent analysis of the criminal history of a location over time. Lombardo claims to have done this by carefully analyzing 20 years of data and also by calling on his experience in the field. As a result, thanks to XLAW, law enforcement officials can be alerted and deployed on the scene before a crime has even happened. At the same time, XLAW provides police officers with details as precise as “genre, height, citizenship, distinguishing features, and biometrics” of a potential suspect.XLAW has a strong predictive component to it. In the case of Venice, for example, State Police boasted that “84% of felonies (“fatti-reato”) that have been either attempted or committed had been foreseen by the system”. As a result, XLAW is regularly portrayed as a success story.",

    "Description": "In 2010, the Slovenian government introduced the e-Sociala (e-social services) program to optimize social transfers, such as social and unemployment benefits, child benefits, subsidies, etc. that make up the welfare system. The system consists of many connected databases (Ministry of Public Administration, 2009) and was designed to optimize the work process for social workers, evaluate their work, and prevent errors when processing applications for social welfare. The system has been upgraded since its introduction and that it now includes AI, ADM, and machine learning capabilities.\n\nFor example, citizens can use ADM to learn their social rights and see a prediction of benefit payments so that they can make an informed evaluation and calculation before applying for social benefits. Furthermore, the application processes for several social rights/benefits is fully automated, e.g., to research previous decisions related to social benefits and to see new (informative) ones for particular applicants. E-sociala can also detect people from the same family and access their financial information, thereby simplifying the process for social workers. The goal is to further automate the process so that the system can create a full “social rights profile” for every applicant. The system will then be able to see what benefits a particular citizen is eligible for, for how long, and for what amount of money. For legal reasons, social workers still need to personally evaluate, print, sign and send every application. At the moment, the process still requires some manual (human) intervention which is recorded and analyzed in order to improve the system and prevent errors.",

The system was designed to monitor pupils’ grades and absences, to search for specific learning patterns, and help teachers find “problematic” pupils. However, the system has been critized. The educational experts were  critical of the methodology and they claimed that grades and absences by themselves were not sufficient indicators to reliably detect learning problems. In addition, the budget was too small, and thus researchers had to use interpolated data and take other shortcuts. The public debate also addressed another related issue: that a lot of school data is collected and owned by a private (commercial) contractor - which has a de facto monopoly on AI development in education.",

The Council developed the system by buying an IBM product called iBase. The approach to using the system has been internally developed. It is noted that the aim is to empower ‘lead professionals to make the best use of data they are legally able to see, and is not about replacing decision making or interpretation with system algorithms or decisions’. The stated aim is to enable a more ‘holistic’ understanding of people, needs and services. Future goals include developing decision making tools, building performance reporting tools, building threshold and alerting tools and rolling the system out to more users, as well as connecting more data.",

    "Description": "This work aims to contribute to the reduction of academic failure at higher education, by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of their academic path, so that strategies to support them can be put into place. A dataset from a higher education institution is used to build classification models to predict academic performance of students. The dataset includes information known at the time of student’s enrollment – academic path, demographics and social-economic factors. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there’s a strong imbalance towards one of the classes. Algorithms to promote class balancing with synthetic oversampling are tested, and classification models are trained and evaluated, both with standard machine learning algorithms and state of the art boosting algorithms. Our results show that boosting algorithms respond better to the specific classification task than standard methods. However, even these state of the art algorithms fall short in correctly identifying the majority of cases in one of the minority classes. Future directions of this study include the addition of information regarding student’s first year performance, such as academic grades from the first academic semesters.",

    "Description": "The Instituto Português do Sangue e da Transplantação (IPST) is a public institute of the Ministry of Health and the recognized authority for the collection and regulation of blood donation and transplantation at the national level. Operational productivity of IPST is crucial for the blood supply chain in Portugal since it monitors the quality and safety of donation, procurement, processing, storage, preservation and distribution of human blood, blood components, organs, tissues and human origin cells. The goal of LAIfeBlood project is to provide IPST with new tools to improve the efficiency of blood supply operations in Portugal. LAIfeBlood project is particularly focused on: (1) extracting temporal and geographical patterns from historical collection and transfusion data; (2) developing predictive models for the expected collections and transfusions in different temporal and geographic areas; and (3) developing software tools to optimize the planning of collections at the national level according to the availability of IPST teams and resources and collection events. LAIfeBlood project tackles an important societal challenge of maximizing blood services effectiveness while minimizing wastage of an increasingly scarce resource and optimizing the efficiency of blood supply operations. We expect our results to be used to derive implementable policies at IPST to plan collections and manage the daily inventory rebalancing problem, as well as contributing to the development in the field of optimization and dynamic supply chain management.",

    "Description": "The traditional model used for the prediction of mobility flows, both on foot and with vehicles, is the so-called \"gravitational\". Inspired by Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, it establishes that the flow of mobility between two places, for example two neighborhoods of a city, is proportional to their population and inversely proportional to their geographical distance.In practice, the gravitational model is often inaccurate because it is based on only two variables, distance and population, and is unable to capture complex relationships between them.\nThe Institute of Science and Information Technologies of the National Research Council (Cnr-Isti) together with the Bruno Kessler Foundation of Trento and the Argonne National Laboratory in the USA, has developed \"Deep Gravity\", an algorithm that adds to the gravitational model two fundamental ingredients, namely: the use of different variables that describe the points of interest in a place such as restaurants, hotels, hospitals and streets, and the ability to capture complex relationships between these variables thanks to the use of deep learning.",

    "Description": "SAFERS aims at developing, over the course of three years, an innovative platform to improve the management of forest fires, whose impact has greatly increased also due to climate change. In addition to damaging the natural ecosystem as well as the social and productive fabric, fires also release a large quantity of greenhouse gasses and many pollutants that contribute to the deterioration of air quality. To reduce the impact of future forest fires, SAFERS will develop a new Big Data platform coupled with new information systems based on Artificial Intelligence, using many data sources, in particular the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. In addition to satellite data, the project will also analyse in real time data from ad hoc monitoring cameras, social media as well as mobile phones of professional users, volunteers and citizens who, through chatbots, may report the situation they are observing.",

In addition, other added values are improved road surface quality, increased infrastructural competitiveness of an region for investment, insights on travel and tourism patterns, reduced impact of road works on citizens in the form of downtime and congestion, savings in agency costs by the public administration and lower road user costs for citizens and infrastructure users.\nThe cloud-based solution can potentially be used by other public administrations in Europe, since the problem described is common to all public administrations.",

The user who uses the voice assistant is identified, on a one-off basis, through the connection between the Amazon user and the digital identity (eg: SPID). This identification operation is carried out only once and is valid until explicit revocation. When the user activates the application with \"Alexa, speak with Torino certificates\", the user is recognized, the e-mail address that will be used for delivery is remembered (the one defined in the Amazon profile), and is asked to confirm the certificate request. Upon your consent, the system requests the certificate (in pdf) from the Registry / ANPR and sends it to the registered box.",

Most of these objectives could not have been achieved without the development of new technology to automate drug storage and dispensing and the digitalization of all processes, from prescriptions to checking adherence within the project of reforming the HUMS outpatient pharmacy unit.  Different innovations have been implemented: an electronic prescription platform (integrated with the health systems in use at the HUMS), a patient appointment system, a robot for automatic storage and dispensing in assisted and unassisted mode, a full traceability system for the entire drug management process, primary and secondary adherence records system, improvements to the website, an application (app) and a contact and information system in the dispensing area to facilitate communication with patients.",

    "Description": "The eHealth technology (a wristwatch and app with which the whereabouts of the patients can be traced) is used to provide elderly people with Alzheimer more freedom. The technology enables the nurses and the institution to trace the elderly better, thus giving them more freedom to move around. The technology fits in a policy of the organisation to work with life cycles. This means that a team decides how much freedom a specific patient can have. The aim is to grant as much freedom as possible, given the patient health and mental situation. If people can move around more, they stay fit longer both physically and mentally, the organisation argues. The organisation also emphasizes that the ICT tool is above all a supportive tool and that the most important element still is the (risk) assessment of the patient.\nThe eHealth innovation was an example of how such technologies can support health professionals, as personal health data is collected, stored and communicated between relevant stakeholders. In general, in health technology, patient data is used to provide more precise and personalized health care (e.g. personalized interventions, predicating and preventing diseases). In this specific case of health technology, a mobile device, mobile sensor, and wearables were used to increase the health and wellbeing of users. This device with sensor technology helps Alzheimer patients to walk around more freely again in a nursing home and outside the nursing home through GPS tracking, which would otherwise be impossible for those suffering from dementia. In that sense, the ICT technology is important and vital for the innovation.",

    "Description": "The objective of the Track AI project (https://dive-medical.com/TrackAI.html) is to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into the DIVE medical device[1] so it can “estimate the probability of the patient having a certain pathology”. The innovation was created due to the difficulty in exploring the visual function (e.g. vision) among children, but it can be used for both collaborative and non-collaborative patients (i.e. patients who are able to collaborate with physicians as opposed to patients – such as children – who are unable to collaborate with physicians). The partnership allows technology to be shared between organisations and combines their experience in the health and technological fields. The innovation in this project consists of the development of a specific app that uses AI in a Huawei P30 mobile phone in order to analyse data from visual explorations using the DIVE-Medical device. This innovation helps physicians to determine whether or not a patient has a visual impairment by comparing patient gaze patterns with the database generated by previous diagnoses (which can be accessed online and offline). In some cases, it also makes it possible to estimate the probability of a particular pathology. The project is focused on non-collaborative patients, but it can also be used in collaborative patients (i.e. patients that are able to collaborate with physicians as opposed to patients – such as children – who are unable to collaborate with physicians).",

    "Description": "The vaccine conversation monitoring platform was, in this initial phase of the project, developed in three languages: Italian, French and Spanish.\nThe platform, accessible via credentials, monitors information flows from Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia and Google Trends in real time. The platform allows the collection, analysis, aggregation and display of data extracted from different sources. This is possible thanks to the construction of the platform on three different levels (layers): the Data layer, the Analysis layer and the Visualization layer.\nThe Data layer constantly collects raw data from the web and social media, pre-processes them through an initial screening and an initial cleaning of the raw data, obtained through the relative Application Programmer Interface, API: Twitter API, Reddit API, Google Trends API. To collect the data, keyword filters were used, created and validated through a structured framework, on the basis of recurrence and relevance criteria (6).\nThe Analysis layer has the function of analyzing the processed and cleaned data through the generation of graphs, thus making the extracted data understandable and relating them to each other. The processes that allow the geolocalization of tweets take place on this layer, and two processes based on machine learning algorithms: Influencer analysis and Early-signal detection:\nInfluencer analysis makes it possible to identify the most influential and most active users in the conversation about vaccines on Twitter, with the aim of monitoring the crucial \"nodes\" of the communities involved, both in vaccine-friendly communities and in the no vax community;\nEarly-signal detection allows the interception of users who use new hashtags, therefore users new to the topic of vaccines. The hashtag (created by inserting the # key in front of the desired word or phrase, for example, #vaccini or #iononmivaccino) is a tool that serves as a thematic aggregator on some social networks and was introduced by Twitter as a keyword signal and to draw users' attention to some particular words or themes.\nFinally, the Visualization layer allows the visualization of the results, makes the extrapolated information understandable and communicates it in a simple but representative way, in order to understand the displayed data more easily.",

MIREL addresses both conceptual challenges, such as the role of legal interpretation in mining and reasoning, and computational challenges, such as the handling of big legal data, and the complexity of regulatory compliance. It bridges the gap between the community working on legal ontologies and NLP parsers and the community working on reasoning methods and formal logic. Moreover, it is the first project of its kind to involve industrial partners in the future development of innovative products and services in legal reasoning and their deployment in the market. MIREL promotes mobility and staff exchange between SMEs to academies in order to create an inter-continental interdisciplinary consortium in Law and Artificial Intelligence areas including Natural Language Processing, Computational Ontologies, Argumentation, and Logic & Reasoning.",

The target data are from the NoiPA system that provides HR shared services to around 100 Italian central and local public administrations through the NoiPA digital platform, used by 2.2 mln civil servants.\nThe NoiPA platform [NoiPA] a series of open datasets that are created through additional elaboration and analysis of data stored in the platform that collects, enhances, and analyses data from NoiPA. The published data covers:\n-Administered personnel and Administrations (methods of salaries crediting, bodies organizational structures)\n-Working relationship (personnel classification, contracts, reasons for hiring of work relationships, etc) \n-Economic treatment (deduction detail per dependent family member, tax deductions, family allowances, etc). The sensitivity of the data exposed on the platform requires high standards of privacy protection. AI could enable, notably through the combination of information from different datasets, the (re)identification of personal information even in anonymized and aggregated datasets. Dataset can hide biased or discriminatory characteristics arising from, for instance, erroneous sampling, variables capturing sensitive background characteristics and the use of proxies.",

This register must then be made accessible so that it can be consulted for any doubts in distinguishing real images from falsified images. The TrueBees project was among the winners (fifteen selected out of 90 applications from all over Europe) of the call launched by Trublo. Trublo is part of the European NGI (Next Generation Internet) initiative, funded under the Horizon 2020 program, to promote studies on how new technologies, and in particular blockchain, can revolutionize the media sector. Trublo supports the launch of industry research projects for the development of new software, platforms or tools.\nThe term blockchain technologies indicates a set of traceability techniques that allow to retrace and reconstruct the processing chain, the life cycle of the multimedia data, through the traces left by the acquisition system, the encoding and re-encoding of the signal, but also to shed light on provenance, manipulation and sharing on social networks.",

The new version of the platform provides software, which through its AI capabilities, is able to identify tenders with a high risk of corruption. The results of the beta test of this system were that 26% more tenders with unfounded selection of the winner were identified, 37% more tenders with groundless disqualification, and 298% more with participants' conspiracy. The system is intended to complement and support the work done by experts - making their work more efficient.",

    "Description": "The Information System Authority of Estonia is using machine learning for detecting anomalies and incidents on the traffic of the Estonian data exchange layer - X-Road.  Predictive analytics is used to decide where to send the police for traffic regulation. The system is well used in cities; however the algorithm does not yet work well in rural areas.  The Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund matches job seekers with open positions using AI. It helps job seekers get matched with the right job. The current job matching algorithm is developed further with job seeker profiling algorithm.  Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board is using machine learning to detect land mowing. Satellite images are analysed to detect whether agricultural land has been mowed. This is necessary as mowing land is one of the requirements for receiving government grants. Before satellite image analysis this work was carried out manually using on-spot control.  In line with the Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia, the government encourages the use of AI applications and test projects. The aim is to have at least 50 use cases in public sector by 2020. Interestingly, Estonia has also launched a task force to collect ideas from the general public on how to best make use of AI for the development of Estonia's economy and state.",

For example, they can do so for a maximum of 30 nights per year and a maximum of 4 people at a time. They must also report it to the municipality. Not everyone adheres to those conditions. The municipality sometimes receives reports, for instance from neighbours or rental platforms, who suspect that a home has been rented out without meeting those requirements. If such a report is filed, employees of the department of Surveillance & Enforcement can start an investigation. From 1 July 2020, a pilot will be carried out for six months with an algorithm that supports the employees of the department of Surveillance & Enforcement in their investigation of the reports made concerning possible illegal holiday rentals. The algorithm helps prioritize the reports so that the limited enforcement capacity can be used efficiently and effectively. By analyzing the data of related housing fraud cases of the past 5 years, it calculates the probability of an illegal holiday rental situation on the reported address.",

A dangerous traffic situation or disturbance from people or cafes can also be reported. This system used to be a collection of drop-down menus, from which the user would pick the category that best suited their report. The department responsible for a certain category would then take care of the report. However, as the municipality is a complex organisation, there are countless categories. Many times the wrong category would be chosen, resulting in delays. Now, an algorithm recognizes certain keywords, for example, waste and sidewalk. From these keywords, it determines which category it belongs to, and ultimately, which department within the municipality should examine the case. As a result, there are fewer administrative steps for the person reporting on the issue. Also, the report can be processed much faster, because it arrives at the right department more quickly.",

This can be achieved either by automating the telephony itself (optimization of a channel) or by adding additional communication channels to telephony (multi-channel approach, hybrid approach). While personal contact with an employee is usually necessary for specific problem solving, the simple provision of information and forwarding of information can also be implemented via other, more automated, channels. We follow the suggestions for action recommended in the study Uniform telephone numbers for authorities in the European Union (IfG.CC, 2010) and formulate the project objective to increase the accessibility of D115 and to create expanded and combined access channels to information from authorities. In addition, the citizen assistant should use and promote the increasing digitalization of services of the Berlin administration. For this purpose, interfaces to services are integrated or created. As a result, the citizens will have convenient online access to the services of the Berlin administration.",

REBUILD follows a user-centred and participated design approach, aiming at addressing properly real target users needs, ethical and cross-cultural dimensions, and at monitoring and validating the socio-economic impact of the proposed solution. The technological ambition is to use AI-based solutions (user profiling, skills/needs matching, chatbots) for the development of a usable, accessible, smart ecosystem for both the target groups. The methodological challenge is to adopt a participatory co-design approach, involving both the target groups since the very early stage of the project, taking into consideration users needs, expectations, perceived gaps, cultural differences.",

Data about local services and migrants will feed user-friendly tools for employability and career guidance, whilst assessing supply and demand of migrants skills. The platform will also focus on the social, educational and cultural needs of migrants and how these fit to existing services offered by local hosts. Overall, the system will allow public authorities and guidance professionals to offer a personalised service to migrants based on real needs and the opportunities available to them. The NADINE system will be based around two key banks of a data repository of information about host societies and migrants from which a range of services will be produced. As users access the services, more data will be captured to enhance the existing banks and feed reliable information into the system.",

    "Description": "Limerick City and County Council operate the Housing Assistance Payment Shared Service Centre (HAP SSC) on behalf of the local government sector and are continuously striving for ways to improve their business. The organisation deals with more than 47,000 tenancies and 27,000 landlords, makes payments in excess of 400million, and collects more than 100million in rents. By 2021 it is anticipated that the HAP SSC will deal with 80,000 tenancies, 55,000 landlords and 600million in payments. In order to help deal with these volumes, the deployment of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in the HAP Shared Service Centre was investigated. During 2018 a proof of concept pilot project was carried out by Agilisys, examining 3 micro processes within the centre. The proof of concept project demonstrated that opportunities for efficiencies and savings can be achieved through the deployment of RPA. Applying the outcome of the proof of concept project to a business case, it was concluded that if 10 complex processes could be replaced by RPA, then considerable savings could be made, while at the same time improving services to all key stakeholders. The HAP SSC is now seeking to identify existing processes where RPA may be immediately deployed, as well as opportunities for further business systems integration and automation within the HAP SSC.",

    "Description": "The DVSA applied a clustering model against garage test data from the last 3 months, as there was no labelled data available. The clustering model grouped MOT centres based on the behaviour they show when conducting MOT tests.\nThe DVSA created a risk score for each garage in Great Britain. The risk score combined the output of the clustering algorithm with historical data about how frequently garages had been disciplined for not applying correct MOT standards. This allowed the DVSA to rank garages and their testers, and helped the DVSA identify regional trends. The DVSA updated their garage test data every 3 months. This allowed the DVSA to ensure the model used fresh data whilst also providing stability to garage ratings, providing examiners 3 month windows with which to visit garages.",

The current trials use still human labor inside the shuttle, ensuring everything runs smoothly and safely. If the steward would to be taken out of the shuttle, the robot buses should be remotely operated, similar to the air traffic control. One out of three of the Aurinkolahti survey respondants estimated they could use a robot bus without human personnel inside the shuttle.",

The City’s latest trials focusing on AI and robotic process automation sought answers to a variety of questions, such as the following: can AI help with the management of employment?\ncan AI benefit work shift planning?\ncan AI help gain a more realistic and accurate situational picture of traffic emissions in Helsinki?\ncan AI help with the analysis of performance reviews to enable the development needs of employees to be supported better than before?\ncan robotic process automation be used to facilitate the quality monitoring of student information?\ncan a chatbot guide and advise business travellers?\nwhat is the benefit of a neural network-based AI identifying signatures in PDF documents?\n“The trials have also confirmed that it is often not necessary to replace an entire work phase with a robot. In many cases, robot assistance is enough,” said project manager Ville Meloni.",

Authorities in the city want to address the health and safety concerns of residents and visitors enduring excessive noise from modified exhaust systems on cars, motorbikes and other vehicles travelling on the Stalenstraat.\nNokia is deploying its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Scene Analytics technology for the proof-of-concept project. The solution utilises data from microphones and installed cameras, used as IoT sensors along the road. If an approaching vehicle exceeds the pre-determined threshold, the street-deployed microphones and cameras begin recording.\nNokia Scene Analytics adds intelligence to the event data transmitted from the sensors using a decibel-powered algorithm for audio analysis and automated number plate recognition (ANPR). This information is sent to authorities who receive quantified observations and orientations in order to make informed decisions on ‘if’ and ’how’ they will address the issue.",

    "Description": "According to the law in Spain, the citizens who are facing complex economic or social situations cannot be cut off from basic supply services (gas, water or electricity). When the suppliers detect unpaid invoices, before cutting off the service, they must do a consultation to the municipality to know if the citizen or family is facing a situation of social vulnerability. The municipalities receive monthly lists from the companies in different formats and have to go through a costly bureaucratic manual process in order to validate if a citizen is in social or economic risk. The solution developed by AOC automatizes this complex process of data verification by improving the interoperability between the companies and the municipalities and between the municipalities and other administrations to verify the data.​",

Sometimes the transcriptions of the meetings are needed, especially when the judgment is escalated to higher instances. Given the recording of the meeting, the video clip is examined to find out, for example, where exactly something was said or who was named. At the moment, in the Basque Country, administration transcripts are made by manually reviewing the videos of all the sessions. Thus, it's not possible to easily search for words, phrases, and generic entities across the video clip and there isn't any correlation between the speech and the person who pronounced it.\n\n \n\nExpected benefits\nConverting voice data into searchable text using automated transcription services may save significant time and create actionable value. With this solution, 100% manual transcription is no longer necessary, and efforts can be focused on correction and completion.\n\nIn addition, if a court case is taken to a higher level, it will also save time by making it easier to find the exact points in the video in which some information has been said.",

    "Description": "An AI Pilot will tackle the use of machine learning for document review/classification in administrations. The pilot will identify different use-cases in document classification, with a focus on investigative activities, where huge volumes of unstructured data (documents, emails) need to be reviewed by given deadlines to identify documents that are relevant for a particular matter. The AI Pilot will: (i) compare different machine learning algorithms and different model approaches; (ii) evaluate the added value of applying machine learning; (iii) assess the interoperability requirements for operating them, i.e. to integrate and exploit machine learning on top of existing document repository and document review systems; (iv) assess legal and organisational aspects that could result from using machine learning by administrations for document classification",
