    "Description": "NLP is used to automatically classify incoming telephone questions at the 1700 (Flemish Infoline), to integrally transcribe and document the conversations, and to suggest answers. Informatie Vlaanderen use it to detect and categorise the incoming questions faster and more 'finely-meshed', and also integrate this 'finely-meshed' into the editorial management. In this way, the answers can be suggested more quickly, more adequately and also more 'automatically' to the answer provider, regardless of the chosen communication channel (oral or written). In essence, the project aims at two objectives: (1) the quicker and more efficient capturing and categorising of the question, and (2) the quicker and more efficient forwarding of the 'correctly captioned' question to the 'correct' answer provider with the 'correct' skills, whereby a valid and standardised answer (suggestion) is immediately sent along with it (so that the answer provider does not have to look up the intended answer script).",

    "Description": "In the Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board (ARIB), AI is used in order to detect whether the agricultural grasslands have been mowed or not using image recognition. This system, called SATIKAS , uses deep learning methods and convolutional neural network approaches to analyse the satellite data coming from the European COPERNICUS programme to automatically detect whether mowing has taken place on the Estonian grasslands. The optical satellite images from Sentinel 1 and 2 are analysed together with reference data of farmer fields, historical inspection logs and meteorological data from the Estonian Weather Service. This AI system is now regarded as one of the first AI applications used by the government in Estonia. The SATIKAS system is still under development and will expand its features and capabilities in the near future.",

    "Description": "The Tallinn transport Dep. started developing a machine vision application in autumn 2018 in collaboration with Sifr OU. The main objective of this application is to identify the traffic load within Tallinn, i.e. how many cars drive in and out of the city in a day in order to make city transport planning related decisions based on such data (e.g. parking issues, road construction, etc.). Three cameras were selected on intersections in Tallinn to train the application to count the vehicles passing by the cameras. The training of the application was a crucial process in developing the solution since there was no ready-made solution available that suited the circumstances of Tallinn. The result is an application that uses machine vision to count buses, cars, lorries and motorcycles and in the future hopefully also pedestrians, cyclists and like with a 70% accuracy on the traffic load in a certain area when previously there no such information available at all.",

The innovations relate to: (1) The development of a detection algorithm that uses relevant data and variables and effectively detects companies in difficulty (URSSAF, DIRECCTE, Banque de France data, etc.); (2) The development of a data loading computer system capable of regularly and automatically refreshing data from operational databases. The objective is to dynamically detect 2 to 5 new SMEs per month on the scale of Bourgogne Franche-Comtï¿½.\nExpected impacts in terms of digital transformation: an even more effective decentralized State action to support weakened companies. Ultimately, it is a real ï¿½secure social networkï¿½ centered on the company which will become the daily tool of public actors mobilized around companies in difficulty.",

La Bonne Boite is one of the most used job searching services in France and it is about to be further developed in order to target more specific types of jobseekers, like students, that are looking for part-time jobs. This search engine improves a jobseeker's chance of securing a job interview on the basis of spontaneous job applications. La Bonne Boite's computer code can be copied and used by others. There is also an Application Programming Interface (API) which enables the duplication of La Bonne Boite on other websites.",

It should be noted that regulatory frameworks often change and institutions will have to maintain an up-to-date virtual assistant knowledge base. This is a NLP Chatbot for Government which provides Software as a Service (SaaP) possibility on a shared platform.",

    "Description": "The Dutch Public Prosecution Service will intensify enforcement on the detention of mobile devices. With smart cameras that automatically forward violations to the Central Judicial Collection Agency (CJIB). The camera takes pictures of each passer-by, showing whether the driver is holding his mobile phone or not. Because the pictures are taken downwards, the driver's face is not in the picture. The license plate does, and the photo shows clearly and clearly whether someone is holding a mobile device behind the wheel. Only those photos where the system suspects that a phone is being held will be forwarded to the CJIB. A staff member carries out the final assessment at the CJIB. This can result in a fine of 240 euros.",

    "Description": "The Netherlands Ministry of Water and Infrastructure Management (RWS) operates a 24h incident management service. Traffic managers process real-time data from 15+ screens, with chances of an accident being missed. Traffic inspectors need to ensure they are optimally positioned in their deployment zone to minimize travel time to accident sites. For this, Data Science for Social Good has been working with Rijkswaterstaat to create a machine learning model using data from incidents recorded between 2012 to 2016, road characteristics, speed and flow traffic data and weather data. The model predicts within a given time window and road segment the probability of an accident. Overlaying this on a heatmap we are able to display to traffic managers the road sections with the highest likelihood of accidents and allow them to better allocate inspectors to road sections to patrol. The solution gives a 3 to 4 times improvement on a baseline, where traffic inspectors patrol random road segments.",

    "Description": "Data generated by IoT sensors enables ProRail to understand conditions it couldnï¿½t previously, with human analysis alone. ï¿½What really helps is using data to create different estimates and insights that they didnï¿½t have before, or correlations that they didnï¿½t see earlier, or maybe calculate options that are beyond human possibilities because we have a computer that can do a million type of calculations,ï¿½ said Thymo van den Brug, manager of development, asset management Information at ProRail, in a recent article on the use of data in the rail system.  As a result, IoT sensor data enables ProRail to optimize train schedules and maintain equipmentï¿½two serious challenges for railway efficiency. To conduct preventative maintenance, ProRail uses a railway track monitoring system that collects data and monitors the state of the track infrastructure on various routes. Data can secure the physical environs as well. ProRail uses algorithms to determine when and where a trespasser might decide to walk on the track, for example.",

It provided twice as many revelations of cheating. The book check is done among students who state that they live away from home, since only students who do not live with their parents can get the loan back from grants. Lï¿½nekassenï¿½s book check in 2018 included 25,000 students. 15,000 were picked out by Artificial Intelligence (machine learning), while 10,000 were picked out by random selection (control group). The results showed that Artificial Intelligence made it easier to find those who are not really living away from home, said the Loan Fund. 5.5% in the control group and 11.6% in the machine learning group did not pass the book check. It shows that the machine learning selection has been twice as effective as the random selection in finding students who have given us incorrect information about housing",

Every year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) receives up to 6,000 reports from Norwegian embassies, delegations, etc. Previously it was extremely difficult to navigate all this information. Since the MFA adopted machine learning and NLP to analyse and classify the content of these documents, it has been possible to find almost all relevant information on a given subject matter. The solution is also used to extract key information in reports and prepare summaries.\nIn the work on developing this solution, the MFA cooperated with the University of Oslo, which provided solutions for categorising the Norwegian language. The plan is to gradually expand the solution with information from archives and external research reports.",

The also has a chatbot component so she can answer questions about how to fill the forms. In the second development stage of the AI-based technology, Antonia will become a hologram, this being the surprise-element for the next stage. This depends on how fast we will work out the technical aspects, so there is \"no time estimation for the complete implementation\" according o the local officials in Cluj-Napoca. The project is estimated to be completed within 30 months' period. Antonia has been launched in April 2018 and functions around the clock.",

    "Description": "The filing of fake police reports is quite common in Spain, especially for low level crimes and it can bring significant consequences for individuals, wasting valuable police resources and is often used in combination with other fraudulent behaviour. Spanish national police have adopted the VeriPol. The system was designed to be integrated into the existing Spanish National Police information system called SIDENPOL, allowing for easier use and integration into existing work practices. The database of police reports was made available for the researchers in order to train the AI system on. For this, 1122 reports were used, including 534 true and 588 false reports. VeriPol exploits a combination of Natural Language Processing and machine learning classification algorithms, capable of estimating the probability of false police reports with significant accuracy. In addition to that, the system also enables insights into the differences between false and true police reports.",

VI-DAS will employ a cloud platform to improve ADAS sensor and algorithm design and to store and analyse data at a large scale, thus enabling the exploitation of vehicle connectivity and cooperative systems. VI-DAS will address human error analysis by the study of real accidents in order to understand patterns and consequences as an input to the technologies. VI-DAS will also address legal, liability and emerging ethical aspects because with such technology comes new risks, and justifiable public concern.",

Data that appears to be either clearly wrong or at least questionable will be sent back to the data providers with a request for correction or comment. Until now, such plausibility checks were mostly carried out in two different ways: either by manual controls or by automated procedures using limit values ??and logical tests. This process of mutual plausi checks is very labor intensive. Machine learning can help to carry out the controls more quickly and more precisely.",

The bureaucratic burden is increased by the fact that documents are requested at different places in a redundant manner and that there is usually (still) no electronic data exchange. Immediately after the birth, this creates additional work for many parents - in addition to the often tense domestic situation.\n\nThe guiding principle of the project is: \"The data runs, not the parents\". First, in 2018, a citizen-friendly, only three-page combination form was developed for entering all necessary data once. Thanks to a cross-institutional parents can hand it in directly at the maternity clinic, and the cooperation partners take care of everything else. take care of everything else. Parents now receive their child's birth certificate by post much faster. The parents now receive their child's birth certificate, the tax ID, the entry in the registration system and the child benefit notice much more quickly by post. The child benefit is transferred directly to their account. On this basis, an online service was service was developed in 2019, which will initially be offered as a pilot to a limited target group in June 2020. at the Asklepios Clinic in Altona. The pilot also includes the use of a voice assistance system to enable the combined application to be completed more easily and with fewer barriers.

    "Description": "The Federal Statistical Office Germany currently works in several projects to employ machine learning to text classification problems. In many statistics, text information is collected. For statistical purposes, the texts need to be coded into a set of predefined categories. This is a time consuming task. The main goal of the text classification projects is to relief staff from coding tasks and to improve timeliness of statistical results at the same time. Often these approaches are imperative, because digitization leads to larger data sets that need to be processed in a timely manner.",

Using AI, the province can gain insights as to the current state of vegetation on the Dutch Waddeneilanden (Frisian Islands). Up until this project was started, this vegetation registration was done once very 6 or 12 years by inspectors who would go to the islands. However, this process was both too labor intensive and at large intervals. So now AI interprets satellite images, and hard-to-judge areas are reviewed manually by inspectors. An additional benefit is that many of the vegetation is very sensitive to nitrogen. This means that keeping an accurate eye on the island vegetation also helps draw up accurate nitrogen models.",

    "Description": "Support system for the classification of incidences/complains from citizens in Barcelona. \nIRIS is the service that allows citizens to report incidents or send complaints to the Barcelona City Council for resolution. Through IRIS, citizens can send information and queries, as well as complaints and suggestions for improvement. In this process, the citizen who reports the incident has to classify it using a tree of topics offered through the computer application. This classification is important because it is used to direct the incident directly to the responsible department, thus speeding up the response process. Errors in the thematic classification cause inadequate responses and delays in the resolution of incidents, thus affecting the quality of the service offered.\nAs part of the IRIS service update project, a module called MARIO has been developed, based on machine learning algorithms -Machine Learning- and natural language processing (one of the technologies included in the IA) to simplify the incident classification process for citizens. From the analysis of the free text describing the incident, MARIO suggests to the citizen the most likely categories where the incident fits because he/she chooses the most appropriate category.\nMARIO, which is currently being tested, minimizes the error rate in the initial classification of incidents by greatly reducing manual reclassification processes. Previously, 50% of the communications made needed to be reassigned; now, with MARIO, a hit rate of over 85% is being achieved.\nMARIO has been developed using open source tools -Open Source- such as Python, Scikit-*learn and *Pandas, among others. The algorithm has required a training that has been carried out using a dataset with the topics and questions asked by the citizen previously validated to ensure that they have been correctly classified.\nThis pilot has been used by the Municipal Institute of Informatics to evaluate the techniques and processes of text classification with the following conclusions:\nOften the integration of AI techniques into existing processes has to be accompanied by a restructuring of the data. In the case of IRIS, the wide range of classification options makes the task difficult for a human but makes *IA inefficient. Clustering of categories is recommended\n- It is important to have a quality dataset.\n- In order to ensure good system efficiency, good data preprocessing including cleaning and standardization of this data is necessary.\n- Data anonymization must be taken into account.\n- For good training, it is necessary to have a representative volume of input data that is homogeneous in all categories.",

    "Description": "Two AI tools have been integrated into the IT system of the National Library of Finland (digi.nationallibrary.fi):\n1. Named entity recognition (NER)\n-Stanford NER software to recognize persons and place names from the Finnish historical newspapers. The first training and evaluation data set was created that consists of pages of both journals and newspapers from the time period 1836ï¿½1918. The Stanford NER system was trained using 220 annotated pages and evaluated using 34 pages. The results that were achieved were mostly good: 71 % of person names and 79 % of place names were recognized from the evaluation data.\n2. Image classification\n-Google TensorFlow was used to classify images.\nA training dataset was created that was used to train the classifier model with TensorFlow. Using the trained model, it was possible to classify images into the following groups: advertisements, drawings, notes, pictures, paintings, maps or garbage.\n-The trained model was used to classify 50 000 images and its accuracy was about 70-75% when about 10 000 classified images were manually observed.\n-A graphical user interface was created that enabled an easier way to observe achieved results.",

With the change, the library wanted to enable moving the material freely between different libraries. The system was introduced in May 2019, after which it has been in use but still in the deployment phase. The system has made it possible to reach a situation where the majority of the collection now floats, i.e. moves freely between libraries. IMMS gives public libraries control of collection, space, and float management. IMMS complements your existing ILS and creates an unprecedented level of transparency in your material flow. Utilizing new tools for data collection, items can be tracked to the shelf, shelving cart, transport bin, or storage location.",

In finding, allocating and proactively steering services, the model will make use of the decentralised and open network created by artificial intelligence and smart applications. The model will lead changes in the authoritiesï¿½ operational model and will support these changes by implementing an ethically functioning artificial intelligence network, which will help to allocate the services correctly. In addition to implementing this AI network, the human-centric operations model will be adopted in the case of selected life events, run by the organisations in charge and supported by the AuroraAI support team.\n\nUsing artificial intelligence, the AuroraAI network will make it possible to allocate the current, partly silo-like supply of services in a timely manner to citizens or companies in need of such services. The information gained about those utilising the service will make knowledge-based management a more effective aid for the production of the services.",

The purpose of the project is therefore to develop a tool that can support caseworkers' assessment of whether economic sanctions will have the desired effect or not. The algorithm will analyse which factors have a negative or positive impact on citizensï¿½ probability of becoming more or less available for employment. The algorithm will also provide support the assessment of whether adverse events (i.e. absences from activation offers or interviews) should trigger economic sanctions.",

They wanted to centralize the database. The question is to extract some kind of information out of incoming documents with 2 proofs of concepts. The first one is to see if emails can be analysed to extract persons, functions, phones. Especially structured information are possible. Functions are difficult as it depends on the context.  Another Proof of Concepts is to extract information from forms. First, these letters have to be scanned before they can be analysed. However, the pilots showed that AI for everything is not always possible and 100% accuracy is not possible which requires validation by people. AI cannot understand text because they only correlate patterns. It may therefore be more useful for mailroom automation software.",

This concerns, for example, crop diversification, the maintenance of grassland and the creation of ecological focus areas.\nThe Department of Agriculture and Fisheries supervises the correct and timely implementation of these types of policy measures. Currently, the control is based on spot checks in the field. High-resolution images from various satellites are able to quickly map the correct information. This allows for better follow-up, guidance and control of the farmers. Also possibly. crop damage due to drought or flooding can be objectified more quickly. The project was entitled CAPSAT: CAP stands for 'Common Agricultural Policy' and SAT for 'satellite'.",

    "Description": "Regulations are extremely valuable information that is relevant to everyone in our society. However, the large amount of divergent and incoherent regulation leads to information silos. There are so many different types of documents that there is little structure to be found in them. Moreover, the regulations on a particular subject are often spread over various (basic) laws, amendments to, additions to and improvements to those laws. That is impractical.  Lawyers are working to clarify this by harmonizing (coordinating) and bringing together (codifying) this fragmented legislation. But this does not yet solve the problem sufficiently. With the project 'Smart Regulations' we want to offer a solution by using Artificial Intelligence to train computers to interpret regulations. For example, computers can very accurately extract the correct information from those regulations for specific target groups (this can be people, applications or machines).  \nThe goal is therefore to be able to offer an 'engine' on unstructured information sources from legislation, regulations and decision-making that users can subscribe to in order to get data and additional insights from these information sources more quickly according to their needs. This is how regulation becomes smart. There are even new insights emerging.",

The publisher monitors the quality of the texts translated as a result of the machine translation and, if necessary, corrects the errors in them, from which the machine translation learns and therefore the quality of the translation will improve in the future. The authentic text of the notice, which has legal significance, is in Estonian only. The introduction of machine translation in the Official Gazette was 80% funded by the European Commission.

    "Description": "The Center of Registers and Information Systems introduced an automatic data translation tool in the web environments of the e-Land Register on the 29th of October 2021. The tool helps the user to translate on-screen registry data into English in real time.  The new machine translation solution simplifies the understanding of registry data for non-Estonian speaking citizens. The tool helps the user of the e-Land Register to understand detailed data, such as easements and mortgages. It is a tool based on neural networks. Machine translation creates links from a large database, which improves itself over time, refining vocabulary and thus improving translation quality. However, the official language of the register is Estonian, which is why the translated text is informative and has no legal significance. The machine translation tool was developed in cooperation between Estonia, Latvia and Belgium within the framework of the project for the creation of middleware adapting European machine translation, which was developed by the Latvian cooperation partner TILDE SIA.",

    "Description": "Speech recognition software enables the transcription of a written transcript of a hearing ('the transcript'), which is used to draw up the minutes of the hearing. COMPRISE H2020 project is experimenting a solution for this. Tilde ï¿½ a leading European language technology company ï¿½ in collaboration with the Estonian national Centre of Registers and Information Systems (RIK) has developed a solution for automated transcription of court hearings in all 9 national and regional courts of the country. The solution has brought significant improvements to the efficiency and speed of producing court session recordings and protocolling. Speech recognition models have been adapted for the rather rich domain content ï¿½ more than 800 hours of transcribed audio files have been used for the development of the acoustic models and over 800 million words worth of textual data have been used for the custom language model development. As a result, the solution which provides for real-time, as well as offline speech recognition has high quality of speech recognition, where word error rates (WER) vary between 8 and 15%, and this is a very good result given the actual conditions at court hearings. This solution is built to run on the RIKï¿½s infrastructure thus safeguarding the security and availability to authorized users only.",

Working on the basis of existing models, the experts created a machine learning algorithm that, after ï¿½trainingï¿½, is able to find the proverbial needle in the haystack. Using artificial intelligence is not just interesting in drugs cases involving shipping containers but can also be valuable for many other police investigations. Above all, automating the search process saves massive amounts of time and frees up police officers for other tasks.",

    "Name": "Taxation and the automatization of property evaluation",
    "Website": "ï¿½",
    "Description": "For years, and with varying degrees of success, the Danish government has tried to centralize and automate tax administration. Attempts to centralize and automate tax collection in 2005 with EFI (Et Fï¿½lles Inddrivelsessystem or One Shared Tax collection system) failed, and EFI was shelved in 2015 (Alfter, 2019, 51). A new system, to collect billions of Danish crowns owed by taxpayers, was expected to be finalized by mid-2019, however, in September 2019, the Auditors of the Danish Parliament, Rigsrevision, published a critical report indicating that tax collection would only be fully up and running by the end of 2020, or later (Rigsrevisionen, 2019).\n\nMissing out on collecting billions of Danish crowns in tax revenue, however, is just one of several automatization concerns on the table of every new minister of finance. One heated discussion is about automatizing the estimation of property values ï¿½ particularly in a context where housing costs are growing significantly in the capital and near larger cities while they are dropping elsewhere, thus affecting property owners in a country where large parts of the population own their own home. Passed in 2017, the Ejendomsvurderingslov (law on property assessment, 2017) states that automatic real estate valuation assessment will become standard practice. In preparation for the law, this fully automated system was described as ï¿½machine assessmentsï¿½ (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 36-37). The system is set to include ï¿½sales prices related to the neighborhood, location and size. Sales price levels are adjusted to take into account the distance to forests and recreation areas, schools, streets, railwaysï¿½. The system will also take into account whether or not there is the possibility to build on the surrounding terrain and whether or not ground pollution is an issue (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). A total of 19 parameters will be used to automatically calculate property value (Version2 Editorial, 2019). A preparatory committee prepared an analysis to guide the government ahead of the legislation. The committee followed the overall line to move from ï¿½subjective to objectiveï¿½ assessments, from human to digital assessments, and from manual to automatic administration, to improve assessments and lower administration costs (Engbergudvalget, 2014, p. 68-69). While it does not explicitly mention it, this model uses a level of machine learning to develop a ï¿½statistical predictive modelï¿½ (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). Furthermore, the overall assumption of the preparatory committee was that machine assessments were more objective than human assessments, where human assessments are considered subjective. As with many other systems, the automated property assessment system has been significantly delayed. Along the way, fears surfaced that it did not comply with Danish administrative law (Mï¿½lsted, 2018). It also proved to be more expensive than the estimate in the initial report regarding the cost of a property valuation calculated by a human (Motzfeldt, 2019-2). This project, and other problematic attempts by the Danish tax authorities to incorporate IT projects, have been described as ï¿½the ministersï¿½ (ï¿½) IT-phantomsï¿½ (Version2 Editorial, 2019). The law to assess property values allows a variation of 40% in the value of a given property ï¿½ 20% either side of the price calculated by the system ï¿½ ï¿½and one does not need to hold a PhD in human behavior to predict that this will lead to protests if or when the system comes into use. Worst case we will see headlines that two newly built and identical houses will be taxed very differently. Could we blame citizens if they ask critical questions why they had to spend billions for a system with such a low level of precisionï¿½ (Motzfeldt, 2019-2).",

In order to comply with strict regulations related to data and child protection, software is used to Anonymization on the police servers in Germany before they are uploaded to Microsoft servers in a non-identifiable way. In the cloud, algorithms analyze the images for pornographic content, identify the faces of victims and abusers and compare them to existing profiles stored in a database. These results are returned to the police for further analysis. This software aims to reduce the workload and mental strain police endure while investigating child abuse",

    "Description": "The Bundesamt fï¿½r Migration und Flï¿½chtlinge (Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, BAMF) has been using automated text and speech recognition systems to identify refugees since 2017. Agency employees can ask asylum seekers to give them access to their cell phone, tablet, or laptop to verify if they are telling the truth about where they come from. The agency has the ability to obtain all the data contained on the devices and run software on it. The software presents the employee with a limited overview of the content, which also includes language analysis of the text retrieved. According to the BAMF, both the software and the hardware was provided by the firm Atos SE, however, VICE Magazine found evidence,   that the mobile forensic technology firm MSAB was also involved. Another tool deployed by the BAMF aims to identify disguised dialects in speech. When an asylum seeker does not have a valid proof of ID, a two-minute voice recording of the person describing a picture in their mother tongue is analyzed by software, which then calculates a percentage of how close the speech comes to a certain dialect.",

The approach starts from the assumption that only the combination of different expertise and different tools in coherent and integrated pipelines can offer effective results in a short time. For this reason, the teams of each \"sub-project\" are interdisciplinary and the individual sub-projects also constitute autonomous projects from a scientific and operational point of view. Precisely the idea that the advancement of knowledge with its applicative implications offers pieces to be organized modularly in multiple ways has convinced us to organize the work in building-blocks projects. The ambitions are multiple and transversal: from the attempt to \"export\" knowledge, techniques, and solutions across disciplines (for example from omics to legal data mining) to the combination of protocols and software to automate the pseudonymization of texts or to the creation of innovative tools for querying legal materials through their automatic annotation to the construction of prediction tools based on data science and Intelligence Artificial, to the attempt to offer understandable explanations on the functioning of the tools produced / used adapting them to the needs / capabilities of the different end users. ? ?All these steps are obviously articulated in full coherence with the corresponding regulatory and ethical framework, convinced that the regulatory and ethical profiles in research are central and go beyond mere adherence to the rules. ?",

This algorithmic-driven monitoring has to be coupled with that of ï¿½open sourcesï¿½, such as ï¿½news articles, websites and social mediaï¿½, by the Italian fiscal authority, Agenzia delle Entrate. The monitoring system has been active since 2016, but was largely unknown to the public until January 2020. It was devised to ï¿½acquire all elements that could be useful in knowing the taxpayerï¿½, thereby helping the institution check the consistency of each individualï¿½s fiscal behavior (Corriere della Sera 2019b).",

    "Description": "In this project we propose a neural network-based document clustering system, which is a genuine content addressable memory system, meaning it clusters and stores text documents so they can be retrieved based on their content. Using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMï¿½s), documents are mapped as points on a semantic map, in a topological order that describes the similarity of their contents. This map is then used as a metaphor to interact with the text corpus, creating an interactive visual analytics tool, allowing for its exploration through different, but correlated views and iteratively selecting and examining document",

    "Website": "https://www.csipiemonte.it/en/project/safers",
    "Description": "SAFERS aims at developing, over the course of three years, an innovative platform to improve the management of forest fires, whose impact has greatly increased also due to climate change. In addition to damaging the natural ecosystem as well as the social and productive fabric, fires also release a large quantity of greenhouse gasses and many pollutants that contribute to the deterioration of air quality. To reduce the impact of future forest fires, SAFERS will develop a new Big Data platform coupled with new information systems based on Artificial Intelligence, using many data sources, in particular the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. In addition to satellite data, the project will also analyse in real time data from ad hoc monitoring cameras, social media as well as mobile phones of professional users, volunteers and citizens who, through chatbots, may report the situation they are observing.",

The target data are from the NoiPA system that provides HR shared services to around 100 Italian central and local public administrations through the NoiPA digital platform, used by 2.2 mln civil servants.\nThe NoiPA platform [NoiPA] a series of open datasets that are created through additional elaboration and analysis of data stored in the platform that collects, enhances, and analyses data from NoiPA. The published data covers:\n-Administered personnel and Administrations (methods of salaries crediting, bodies organizational structures)\n-Working relationship (personnel classification, contracts, reasons for hiring of work relationships, etc) \n-Economic treatment (deduction detail per dependent family member, tax deductions, family allowances, etc). The sensitivity of the data exposed on the platform requires high standards of privacy protection. AI could enable, notably through the combination of information from different datasets, the (re)identification of personal information even in anonymized and aggregated datasets. Dataset can hide biased or discriminatory characteristics arising from, for instance, erroneous sampling, variables capturing sensitive background characteristics and the use of proxies.",

    "Description": "When someone encounters rubbish or a maintenance issue on the street or in a park, they can report this to the municipality via an online reporting system. A dangerous traffic situation or disturbance from people or cafes can also be reported. This system used to be a collection of drop-down menus, from which the user would pick the category that best suited their report. The department responsible for a certain category would then take care of the report. However, as the municipality is a complex organisation, there are countless categories. Many times the wrong category would be chosen, resulting in delays. Now, an algorithm recognizes certain keywords, for example, waste and sidewalk. From these keywords, it determines which category it belongs to, and ultimately, which department within the municipality should examine the case. As a result, there are fewer administrative steps for the person reporting on the issue. Also, the report can be processed much faster, because it arrives at the right department more quickly.",

    "Description": "As part of the  IDBB sub- project Virtual Citizen Assistant, the D115 call center employees of the State of Berlin are to be relieved of citizen-authority interaction and at the same time the provision of information for citizens is to be improved. This can be achieved either by automating the telephony itself (optimization of a channel) or by adding additional communication channels to telephony (multi-channel approach, hybrid approach). While personal contact with an employee is usually necessary for specific problem solving, the simple provision of information and forwarding of information can also be implemented via other, more automated, channels. We follow the suggestions for action recommended in the study Uniform telephone numbers for authorities in the European Union (IfG.CC, 2010) and formulate the project objective to increase the accessibility of D115 and to create expanded and combined access channels to information from authorities. In addition, the citizen assistant should use and promote the increasing digitalization of services of the Berlin administration. For this purpose, interfaces to services are integrated or created. As a result, the citizens will have convenient online access to the services of the Berlin administration.",

The project focuses on making the communication flow of the millions of PECs sent to INPS every year more efficient, through a system that is able to understand the content of the PEC received and automatically direct it to the INPS operator more specialized in the specific response. This has a twofold advantage: it cuts down on INPS communication and response times to the applicant; and optimizes the work of operators by allowing them to devote themselves to activities with maximum added value for the user.",

    "Description": "According to the law in Spain, the citizens who are facing complex economic or social situations cannot be cut off from basic supply services (gas, water or electricity). When the suppliers detect unpaid invoices, before cutting off the service, they must do a consultation to the municipality to know if the citizen or family is facing a situation of social vulnerability. The municipalities receive monthly lists from the companies in different formats and have to go through a costly bureaucratic manual process in order to validate if a citizen is in social or economic risk. The solution developed by AOC automatizes this complex process of data verification by improving the interoperability between the companies and the municipalities and between the municipalities and other administrations to verify the data.?",

The chatbot ï¿½Justitiaï¿½ guides people in search of information directly to the information and functions that are relevant to them. It can also answer simple justice-related questions. Searches of the Companies Register and Land Register can now also be carried out simply and directly online. Links and interfaces to other e-government portals, such as the business service portal and oesterreich.gv.at, mean that information about representation and authorisation now only needs to be updated in a single place.",

    "Description": "Legal proceedings have a peculiarity when it comes to the drafting of judgments. Sometimes the transcriptions of the meetings are needed, especially when the judgment is escalated to higher instances. Given the recording of the meeting, the video clip is examined to find out, for example, where exactly something was said or who was named. At the moment, in the Basque Country, administration transcripts are made by manually reviewing the videos of all the sessions. Thus, it's not possible to easily search for words, phrases, and generic entities across the video clip and there isn't any correlation between the speech and the person who pronounced it.\n\n \n\nExpected benefits\nConverting voice data into searchable text using automated transcription services may save significant time and create actionable value. With this solution, 100% manual transcription is no longer necessary, and efforts can be focused on correction and completion.\n\nIn addition, if a court case is taken to a higher level, it will also save time by making it easier to find the exact points in the video in which some information has been said.",

The AI Pilot will: (i) compare different machine learning algorithms and different model approaches; (ii) evaluate the added value of applying machine learning; (iii) assess the interoperability requirements for operating them, i.e. to integrate and exploit machine learning on top of existing document repository and document review systems; (iv) assess legal and organisational aspects that could result from using machine learning by administrations for document classification",
