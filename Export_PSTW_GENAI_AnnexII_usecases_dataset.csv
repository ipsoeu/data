PSTW-1454;Classification and automatic sorting of CEMs at the Italian National Institute for Social Security (INPS);https://www.agendadigitale.eu/cittadinanza-digitale/inps-ecco-come-usiamo-lia-a-vantaggio-dei-cittadini/;One of the most important channels by which citizens can communicate with INPS is via certified email (CE). On a practical level, when the INPS operator received the CE, he reads the text and any attachments, understands the subject matter (e.g., pensions, civil invalidity, redundancy payment), and then sorts it to the official in charge of answering the subject. At the beginning of 2021, INPS started experimenting with the Open Source version of GPT-2, and then moved on to BERT, another Machine Learning model that also leverages the Transformers architecture and was developed by Google. The entire system was developed and executed in-house in the INPS Data Centres, precisely to fully satisfy GDPR and confidentiality requirements related to the sensitivity of citizens' data. It has accelerated the process of citizen communication with the Institution, it is active in 10 Italian cities of varying size and geographic area, including Rome, Milan and Naples and it has currently processed more than 1 million CEs. When fully operational, counting all territorial offices, it is estimated that between 30,000 and 40,000 working days per year will be saved. INPS was awarded by IRCAI, UNESCO's International Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence, in the world Top 10 projects supporting the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).;National;Italy;IT;National Institute for Social Security (INPS);Central-government;Social protection;Social protection n.e.c.;Implemented;2021;;Internal management;Internal primary processes;No;No;Artificial intelligence;G2G;;;;;;;x;x;x;;x;x;;;;;;;https://www.agendadigitale.eu/cittadinanza-digitale/inps-ecco-come-usiamo-lia-a-vantaggio-dei-cittadini/;Learning;Machine learning;Generative AI;Optimisation;;text classification;04/10/2024

Users can upload a series of documents on the subject in question and get back an AI-generated briefing in the EU Institutions’ preferred format, that is, with a basic summary, the line-to-take, defensive points, etc.  eBriefing output, like all AI-generated output, needs to be checked for accuracy and style before passing it on. eBriefing delivers a first draft to simplify the process, not a final document. Can I use it in any EU language? eBriefing is connected to eTranslation, so you can submit and receive documents in any EU language along with the others eTranslation supports. How does eBriefing know what to include in its draft?
eBriefing uses the power of the latest generation GPT models, but to get a proper briefing it works with the documents, you, the user, upload. These could be older briefings, general information on a topic, information about the upcoming event for which the briefing is needed, etc. Extensive tests have been carried out to develop a prompt that generates the output in the format usually used at the EU institutions, but with a little tweaking, the output can be adapted to other countries’ conventions or just turned into an informal summary of several documents. Especially when used for official purposes, the output needs to be reviewed and checked. What document types can it handle? eBriefing accepts docx, txt or PDF files. Only PDF files containing text will be processed. If they contain a scanned document, eBriefing cannot process them.

PSTW-2120;Leveraging Large Language Models for Topic Classification in the Domain of Public Affair ;https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02864;The analysis of public affairs documents is crucial for citizens as it promotes transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making. It allows citizens to understand government policies, participate in public discourse, and hold representatives accountable. This is crucial, and sometimes a matter of life or death, for companies whose operation depend on certain regulations. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to greatly enhance the analysis of public affairs documents by effectively processing and understanding the complex language used in such documents. In this work, we analyse the performance of LLMs in classifying public affairs documents. As a natural multi-label task, the classification of these documents presents important challenges. In this work, we use a regex-powered tool to collect a database of public affairs documents with more than 33K samples and 22.5M tokens.

Prior to Titormos, citizens could only submit requests by calling a phone number during limited working hours on weekdays. With this specific solution, citizens can be informed about information concerning the city but also, most importantly, submit a problem that concern them and is of a local nature in matters of cleanliness, such as garbage collection, matters of city lighting, policing, management of stray animals, complaints, etc. After collecting the necessary information, Titormos saves it and displays the ticket – request ID and sends a relevant confirmation email. The bot is also connected to chatgpt and can answer free form questions from citizens. Finally, in the future, there will be a different version for city administrators such as the Mayor, which will be able to connect the chatbot directly to the database of requests and also to the Human Recourses (HR) database via AI, so that it can accept questions in natural language and give administrative responses such as request statistics. Also, for citizens who do not have access to or do not use computers, a voice portal for Citizens who can also submit a request and receive relevant information has been created and is active.

The objective is to promote national cooperation on AI for text tasks and create conditions for shared solutions in the public sector.The ultimate goal is to support public sector employees and free up their time so they can focus on more creative and interpersonal tasks. Success requires public sector organisations to share critical resources while sharing the burden of gathering the data needed to create truly competent and flexible solutions. The first phase of this initiative focuses on data generation, change management, identifying use cases, and developing a prototype for an AI assistant using LLMs. Svea is the prototype for a shared digital assistant, which is under development in this project. The AI-based prototype will be designed to help public sector workers with text-based tasks. Currently, based on the Mixtral open language model from the French company Mistral, more models will be tested in phase 2. Employees will interact with Svea via a web-based chat. Svea can already answer business-specific questions, summarise documents, extract information, rewrite texts in easy-to-read Swedish, and much more.

In order to measure the concrete consequences, 1000 volunteer agents will be equipped with a tool using artificial intelligence to help them write online responses to users' opinions and comments, during their online procedures. Agents will supervise and modify the response before sending it to the user. The data is completely anonymised, so confidentiality is completely preserved for the user. These tools must be put at the service of agents to enable them to be more efficient on certain tasks in order to save time and thus strengthen human contact between public service agents and the French people.

This analysis occurs objectively, in the sense that the laws that are to be analyzed are compared with all those issued from the Constitution onwards. The project is based on the work of building a database of Italian laws, which is constantly updated. A second part of the platform aims to help the parliamentarian or the legislator to write the laws. Through a screen it is possible to insert an input text, for example the title of a new law, and the tool searches for the articles and laws, in the entire database, that may be important to cite or look at if you want to write a law on a certain topic. It does not help to write the law, that remains the task of the expert.

PSTW-2216;Leveraging Large Language Models for Topic Classification in the Domain of Public Affairs;https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02864;"A study focused on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for the classification of topics in public affairs documents, which is considered crucial for promoting transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making. The research involves collecting over 33,000  Spanish text corpora of public affairs documents, using a regex-powered tool to process and annotate legislative initiatives from the Spanish Parlament during a capture period over 2 years. The documents are annotated with multiple labels, reflecting a variety of topics defined by experts in public affairs regulation. The main goal is to assess the performance of four different Spanish LLMs in classifying up to 30 different topics from these documents. 
The experiments show that LLMs are potent tools for processing domain-specific documents, such as those in public affairs, with the combination of a Large Language Model backbone and SVM classifiers yielding accuracies over 85%.
The work has also described a system architecture used for automatic document analysis in public affairs, which includes a Harvester module for data collection, a Document Layout Analysis module, and a Text Processing module that utilizes LLM technology for multi-label topic classification.
Overall, the study contributes a novel functionality for multi-label topic classification within a general document analysis system, presents a new dataset of annotated public affairs documents, and provides experimental evidence of the effectiveness of LLMs in this domain.";National;Spain;ES;BiDA - Lab, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid;Academic-Research;General public services;General services.;Pilot;2024;;Public services and engagement;Internal support processes;Yes;No;Artificial Intelligence;G2G;;;;;;;x;;;x;;x;;;x;x;x;;https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02864;Learning;Machine learning;Generative AI;;;;26/09/2024
PSTW-2218;ITALIAN-LEGAL-BERT: A Pre-trained Transformer Language Model for Italian Law;https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3256/km4law3.pdf;The state of the art in natural language processing is based on transformer models that are pre-trained on general knowledge and enable efficient transfer learning in a wide variety of downstream tasks even with limited data sets. However, these models significantly decrease performance when operating in specific and sectoral domains. This is problematic in the Italian legal context, as there are many discrepancies between the language found in generic open source corpora (e.g., Wikipedia and news articles) and legal language, which can be cryptic, Latin-based, and domain idiolectal formulas. In this paper, we introduce the ITALIAN-LEGAL-BERT model with additional pre-training of the Italian BERT model on Italian civil law corpora. It achieves better results than the ‘general-purpose’ Italian BERT in different domain-specific tasks;Across Countries;Italy;IT;Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies;Academic-Research;General public services;Executive and legislative organs, financial and fiscal affairs, external affairs.;Pilot;2022;;Internal management;Engagement management;Yes;Yes;Artificial Intelligence;G2C;x;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3256/km4law3.pdf;Learning;Machine learning;Generative AI;;;;26/09/2024
PSTW-2219;LEGAL-BERT: The Muppets straight out of Law School;https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.261/;BERT has achieved impressive performance in several NLP tasks. However, there has been limited investigation on its adaptation guidelines in specialised domains. Here we focus on the legal domain, where we explore several approaches for applying BERT models to downstream legal tasks, evaluating on multiple datasets. Our findings indicate that the previous guidelines for pre-training and fine-tuning, often blindly followed, do not always generalize well in the legal domain. Thus we propose a systematic investigation of the available strategies when applying BERT in specialised domains. These are: (a) use the original BERT out of the box, (b) adapt BERT by additional pre-training on domain-specific corpora, and (c) pre-train BERT from scratch on domain-specific corpora. We also propose a broader hyper-parameter search space when fine-tuning for downstream tasks and we release LEGAL-BERT, a family of BERT models intended to assist legal NLP research, computational law, and legal technology applications.;Across Countries;Greece;EL;Athens university of economics and business;Academic-Research;General public services;Executive and legislative organs, financial and fiscal affairs, external affairs.;Pilot;2020;;Internal management;Engagement management;Yes;Yes;Artificial Intelligence;G2C;x;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.261/;Learning;Machine learning;Generative AI;;;;26/09/2024

GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3) is a state-of-the-art language model that can generate text autonomously using machine learning algorithms. This tool is considered very promising. Predictice provides access to 26 million documents, such as court decisions. These are texts that are several pages long - and often even dozens of pages. They are therefore complicated to read and sometimes turn out to be uninteresting after several minutes of reading.
